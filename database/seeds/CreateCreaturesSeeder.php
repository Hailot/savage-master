If damage reduces the nihileth to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the nihileth drops to 1 hit point instead.

Dual State:
A nihileth exists upon the Material Plane in one of two forms and can switch between them at will. In its material form, it has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. In its ethereal form, it is immune to damage from nonmagical weapons. The creature\'s ethereal form appears as a dark purple outline of its material form, with a blackish-purple haze within. A nihileth in ethereal form can move through air as though it were water, with a fly speed of 40 feet.

Void Aura:
The undead nihileth is surrounded by a chilling cloud. A living creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of a nihileth must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be slowed until the start of its next turn. In addition, any creature that has been diseased by a nihileth or a nihilethic zombie takes 7 (2d6) cold damage every time it starts its turn within the aura.

Infecting Telepathy:
If a creature communicates telepathically with the nihileth, or uses a psychic attack against it, the nihileth can spread its disease to the creature. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom save or become infected with the same disease caused by the nihileth\'s tentacle attack.

Nihileth \'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the nihileth can take a lair action to create one of the magical effects as per an aboleth, or the void absorbance action listed below. The nihileth cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- Void Absorbance: A nihileth can pull the life force from those it has converted to nihilethic zombies to replenish its own life. This takes 18 (6d6) hit points from zombies within 30 feet of the nihileth, spread evenly between the zombies, and healing the nihileth. If a zombie reaches 0 hit points from this action, it perishes with no Undead Fortitude saving throw.

Regional Effects:
the regional effects of a nihileth’s lair are the same as that of an aboleth, except as following.

- Water sources within 1 mile of a nihileth’s lair are not only supernaturally fouled but can spread the disease of the nihileth. A creature who drinks from such water must make a successful DC 14 Constitution check or become infected.

Slam:
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If a creature is hit by this attack twice in the same round (from the same or different accursed defilers), the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.

Sandslash (Recharge 5-6):
As an action, the accursed defiler intensifies the vortex of sand that surrounds it. All creatures within 10 feet of the accursed defiler take 21 (6d6) slashing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw.

                    'special_abilities' => 'Darkness Aura:
An adult or older cave dragon can generate an aura of darkness that fills its space and the surrounding 20 feet. This darkness prevents normal vision and darkvision from functioning. Blindsight and truesight function normally. Activating or deactivating the aura is a bonus action.

Earth Glide:
An adult cave dragon glides through stone, dirt, or any sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish glides through water. Its burrowing produces no ripple or other sign of its presence and leaves no tunnel or hole unless the dragon chooses to do so; in that case, it creates a passageway 15 feet wide by 10 feet high. The spell move earth cast on an area containing an earth-gliding cave dragon flings the dragon back 30 feet and stuns the creature for one round unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day):
If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Innate Spellcasting:
the dragon\'s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

at will: detect magic, speak with dead

3/day each: blur, counterspell, darkness, web

1/day each: dispel magic, hold person

Cave Dragon\'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action for one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained (by fallen debris); damage is halved and the creature is not restrained if it makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The creature is freed when it or an adjacent ally uses an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

- A ten foot-wide, ten foot-long crack opens in the cavern floor where the dragon wishes. Any creature occupying that space must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (3d4) piercing damage from the jagged stones at the bottom.

- The dragon summons a swarm of insects as if it had cast insect plague, filling a 20-foot radius sphere within 90 feet of the dragon. Creatures that are in the affected space or that enter it take 22 (4d10) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw. The swarm lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.

Regional Effects:
the region containing a legendary cave dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Poisonous and odorless gases suddenly fill passages and caverns, and just as quickly disperse, within six miles of the dragon’s lair.

- Flash flooding turns tunnels into death traps as tremors create fissures in the stone within six miles of the lair. On the surface, ponds drain away, and long-dry creek beds break their banks in flood.

- Swarms of vermin within one mile of the lair increase in both size and number as they try to escape the dragon’s endless and undiscriminating hunger.

if the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

Claw:
Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.

Tail:
Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

Frightful Presence:
Each creature of the dragon\'s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature\'s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon\'s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6):
The dragon exhales a cone of black poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each target in that area takes 56 (16d6) poison damage and is poisoned if it is a creature; a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw reduces damage by half and negates the poisoned condition. The poisoned condition lasts until the target takes a long or short rest or it\'s removed with lesser restoration or comparable magic.

When the ahu-nixta is reduced to 0 hp, its clockwork armor breaks and the ahunixta exits it. Once out of its armor, the creature’s pulpy mass no longer receives the benefits of the listed Damage or Condition Immunities, except for psychic and prone.

Without its clockwork armor, the ahu-nixta has the following statistics: AC 12, hp 37 (5d10 + 10), Strength 9 (-1), and all its modes of travel are reduced to 20 feet. In addition, it has no attack actions, though it can still cast its spells. The ahu-nixta’s body can form eyes, mouths, and grabbing appendages. Its grabbing appendages can pick up objects and manipulate them, but the appendages can’t be used for combat. The ahu-nixta’s extra appendages can open and close glass-covered viewing ports in the clockwork armor, requiring no action, so it can see and interact with objects outside the armor.

The ahu-nixta can exit or enter its clockwork armor as a bonus action.

Immutable Form:
The clockwork armor of the ahu-nixta is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form, as is the creature that controls it as long as the ahu-nixta remains within the armor.

Elemental Demise:
When an al-Aeshma dies, its body disintegrates into a swirling spray of coarse sand, leaving behind equipment it was wearing or carrying.

Ill Wind:
As a bonus action when in gaseous form, the al.Aeshma can befoul its space with a choking scent. When the al-Aeshma moves through another creature\'s space in gaseous form, the creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn. Ill Wind lasts until the al-Aeshma leaves gaseous form or chooses to end the ability as a bonus action.

1/day each: creation, gaseous form, insect plague, invisibility, major image

The al-Aeshma regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If it takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn\'t function at the start of its next turn. The al.Aeshma dies only if it starts its turn at 0 hit points and doesn\'t regenerate.

Dust Devil:
A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of sand magically forms on a point the al-Aeshma can see within 120 feet of it.

A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the dust devil, including itself, by making a DC 18 Strength check.

As a bonus action, the alabaster tree moves up to five times its speed, leaving a trail of difficult terrain behind it.

Foster the Grasses:
Hallowed reeds within 60 feet of an alabaster tree have advantage on saving throws.

Like Calls to Like:
The alabaster tree knows if a creature within 60 feet of it is good-aligned or not.

The alabaster tree makes two slam attacks.

Slam:
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (3d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) radiant damage and the creature is grappled (escape DC 16).

Serrated Squeeze (Willow Only):
The alabaster tree makes one slam attack against a Large or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is engulfed in razor-sharp leaves, and the grapple ends. While engulfed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside of the leaves, and it takes 13 (3d8) slashing damage at the start of each of the alabaster tree’s turns. An alabaster tree can have only one creature engulfed at a time.

If the alabaster tree takes 15 damage or more on a single turn from the engulfed creature, the alabaster tree must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or release the creature in a shower of shredded leaves. The released creature falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the alabaster tree. If the alabaster tree dies, an engulfed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the leaves and branches by using an action to untangle itself.

Toss (Oak Only):
One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the alabaster tree is thrown up to 40 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

Cloud of Needles (Recharge 5-6, Pine Only):
The alabaster tree fires a cloud of sharp needles at all creatures within 30 feet of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

An alehouse drake can make a touch attack that grants its target +3 to Dexterity-based skill checks and melee attacks but also induces confusion as per the spell. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 13 Charisma saving throw negates this effect.

Alquam\'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Alquam takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Alquam can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Alquam snuffs all light sources within the lair. Spells that create light are dispelled, mundane light sources are extinguished, and magical light sources are suppressed. Even light created by artifacts is reduced to dim light with half its normal radius of illumination. This lasts until initiative count 20 on the following round.

- Haunting, maddening music emanates from a point Alquam can see. Creatures within 50 feet of the origin that can hear the music must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail are charmed, incapacitated, and have their speed reduced to 0 until they take damage or until initiative count 20 on the following round.

- Black tendrils writhe around up to three creatures Alquam can see within 100 feet. The creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained until initiative count 20 on the following round.

Regional Effects:
the region containing Alquam’s lair is warped by the demon lord’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Within 1 mile of the lair all light sources except artifacts shed light to only half the usual radius.

- Owls and other nocturnal beasts become enraged and hostile within 5 miles of the lair, attacking intruders individually and in swarms.

- Within 1 mile of the lair, Alquam can cast his senses into any area of dim light or darkness as if using clairvoyance.

if Alquam dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.

An ammut can only have one Medium or smaller creature swallowed at a time.

If the ammut takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the ammut must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the ammut. If the ammut dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.

Ghost Breath (1/Day):
The ammut inhales the tortured spirits of undead within 30 feet. Each undead creature of CR 1 and lower in the area is automatically destroyed. All other undead must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Absorb Spirit (1/Day):
The ammut attempts to absorb the spirit of a dead or undead creature in its belly. The creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be absorbed by the ammut. A creature absorbed this way is destroyed and can’t be reanimated, though it can be restored to life by powerful magic, such as a resurrection spell. The ammut regains hp equal to the absorbed creature’s hp maximum.

The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon\'s choice).
In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.

Fire Incarnate:

Flame Dragon\'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and the area is lightly obscured. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

- The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the point must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and trapped in the ground. A creature trapped in this way is restrained and can’t stand up. A creature can end the restraint if it or another creature takes an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check.

- A wall of fire rises up from the ground within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. Each creature that enters the wall for the first time each turn or ends its turn there takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.

Regional Effects:
the region containing a legendary flame dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles of the lair. Friendships are easily broken and criminal acts are common.

- Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair. Crops wither, producing famines.

- Sulfur geysers form in and around the dragon’s lair. Some of them erupt only once an hour, so they’re spotted only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. A creature on top of an erupting geyser takes 21 (6d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

if the dragon dies, the arguments and misunderstandings disappear immediately and the temperatures go back to normal within 1d10 days. Any geysers remain where they are.

If a creature\'s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon\'s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6):
The dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area takes 91 (26d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. Each creature in that area must also succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or go on a rampage for 1 minute. A rampaging creature must attack the nearest living creature or smash some object smaller than itself if no creature can be reached with a single move. A rampaging creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Shifting Flames:
The dragon magically polymorphs into a creature that has immunity to fire damage and a size and challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon\'s choice).

Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. It can grapple up to three creatures.

Consume the Spark:
The mandriano drains the essence of one grappled target. The target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target’s hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the mandriano regains hp equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way rises 24 hours later as a zombie or skeleton under the mandriano’s control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The mandriano can control up to twelve undead at one time.

Call the Dead (3/Day):
The ancient mandriano animates one humanoid corpse within 60 feet. This works like the animate dead spell, except it only creates zombies and the zombies. The mandriano can control up to twenty zombies at one time.

Sea Dragon\'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action and generates one of the following effects. The dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Four vortexes, each 5 feet in diameter and up to 30 feet tall, appear within the lair where the dragon wishes. Creatures occupying the space where a vortex appears or who enter the vortex for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or be restrained. As an action, a creature can free itself or another creature from a vortex by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The vortexes last until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.

- The dragon creates a wall of living coral on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area takes damage as if touching the wall and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, on whichever side of the wall it wants. Touching the wall releases painful stings that deal 18 (4d8) poison damage, or half that with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to fire damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.

- The dragon bends time around its enemies. Four creatures the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save or be affected by a slow spell. This effect last until initiative count 20 on the following round.

Regional Effects:
the region containing a legendary sea dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Sea life becomes richer within 6 miles of the lair. Schools of fish move into new waters, sharks become common, and whale migration paths shift to pass near the area.

- Water temperatures drop sharply within 6 miles of the lair. Creatures not accustomed to cold suffer exposure to extreme cold while swimming in this water.

- Storms and rough water are more common within 6 miles of the lair.

if the dragon dies, conditions of the sea surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.

The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon\'s choice).
In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.

Void dragons dwell in the empty expanse between the stars, and do not require air, food, drink, or sleep. When flying between stars the void dragon magically glides on solar winds, making the immense journey through the void in an impossibly short time.

Void Dragon\'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The dragon negates natural gravity within its lair (an area affected by its gravitic breath is unaffected). Creatures drift 10 feet away from the ground over the course of a round and are restrained. Flying creatures can move at half speed, unless they have the (hover) tag or use magical flight, in which case they move normally. This effect persists until initiative count 20 on the following round.

- The Void briefly overlaps the dragon’s lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The area spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.

- The dragon rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures it can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist in the same place. Space itself repels the creatures to their original positions. Each creature takes 16 (3d10) force damage and is knocked prone, or takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.

Regional Effects:
the region containing a legendary void dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair. Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for forbidden knowledge.

- Light is muted within 6 miles of the lair. Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can’t create bright light in this area.

- Visitations from otherworldly beings occur and disembodied voices whisper in the night within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair. Celestials, fey, and fiends of CR 2 or lower can slip into the world in this area.

if the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more it is driven insane. An insane creature is frightened permanently, and behaves as if affected by confusion while it is frightened in this way. If a creature\'s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon\'s Aura of Madness for the next 24 hours.

Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6):
The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons:

Gravitic Breath:
The dragon exhales a 90-foot cube of powerful localized gravity, originating from the dragon. Falling damage in the area increases to 1d10 per 10 feet fallen. When a creature starts its turn within the area or enters it for the first time in a turn, including when the dragon creates the field, it must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure the creature is restrained. On a success the creature\'s speed is halved as long as it remains in the field. A restrained creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn. The field persists until the dragon\'s breath recharges, and it can\'t use gravitic breath twice consecutively.

Stellar Flare Breath:
The dragon exhales star fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (13d6) fire damage and 45 (13d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Teleport:
The dragon magically teleports to any open space within 100 feet.

The dragon sees normally through light or heavy obscurement caused by fog, mist, clouds, or high wind.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day):

Magic Resistance:
The dragon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Uncontrollable:
The dragon\'s movement is never impeded by difficult terrain, and its speed can\'t be reduced by spells or magical effects.

Gale-force winds rage around the dragon, making it immune to ranged weapon attacks except for those from siege weapons.

Wind Dragon\'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- Sand and dust swirls up from the floor in a 20-foot radius sphere within 120 feet of the dragon at a point the dragon can see. The sphere spreads around corners. The area inside the sphere is lightly obscured, and each creature in the sphere at the start of its turn must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

- Fragments of ice and stone are torn from the lair’s wall by a blast of wind and flung along a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

- A torrent of wind blasts outward from the dragon in a 60-foot radius, either racing just above the floor or near the ceiling. If near the floor, it affects all creatures standing in the radius; if near the ceiling, it affects all creatures flying in the radius. Affected creatures must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and stunned until the end of their next turn.

When a creature is swallowed by an andrenjinyi, it must make a successful DC 19 Wisdom saving throw each round at the end of its turn or be affected by true polymorph into a new form chosen by the andrenjinyi. The effect is permanent until dispelled or ended with a wish or comparable magic.

**First Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
**Second Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is deafened and frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature is paralyzed and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
**Third Roar.** Each creature makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 44 (8d10) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn\'t knocked prone.

Cloak of Ghostly Shadows:
As a bonus action while in dim light or darkness, the ankou becomes invisible. While invisible, the ankou has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and gains the following:
Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lighting, thunder; bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
Immunity to the grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, and restrained conditions
The ankou can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
The cloak of ghostly shadows ends when the ankou chooses to end it as a bonus action, when the ankou dies, or if the ankou ends its turn in bright light.

The ankou has the celestial type in addition to the dragon type and its weapon attacks are magical.

Bite:
Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) cold damage.

Claw:
Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.

Tail:
Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

Horrifying Presence:
Each creature of the ankou’s choice that is within 120 feet of it must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, its speed is reduced to 0 for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the creature is instead paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the ankou’s Horrifying Presence for the next 24 hours.

Reaper’s Breath (Recharge 5-6):
The ankou exhales cold fire in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead creatures automatically fail the saving throw and treat all damage dealt by this breath weapon as radiant instead of cold.

Change Shape:
The ankou magically polymorphs into any beast, humanoid, or undead creature it has seen before that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the ankou’s choice). Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form and it doesn’t gain any class features or legendary actions of the new form.

Usher of Souls:
The ankou can transport itself and up to eight creatures in contact with it to another plane of existence. This works like the plane shift spell, except dead or incorporeal creatures can be transported and don’t have to be willing. The ankou can’t use this ability to banish an unwilling creature.

Magic Resistance:

Magic Weapons:
Arbeyach\'s weapon attacks are magical.

Innate Spellcasting:
arbeyach\'s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks). Arbeyach can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

at will: poison spray

3/day each: fog cloud, stinking cloud

1/day each: cloudkill, contagion, insect plague

Fear Aura:
Any creature hostile to Arbeyach that starts its turn within 20 feet of it must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw, unless Arbeyach is incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. If a creature\'s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to Arbeyach\'s Fear Aura for the next 24 hours.

Aura of Virulence:
Creatures that would normally be resistant or immune to poison damage or the poisoned condition lose their resistance or immunity while within 120 feet of Arbeyach. All other creatures within 120 feet of Arbeyach have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that cause poison damage or the poisoned condition.

Swarm Prince:
Arbeyach can communicate with spawns of Arbeyach and all vermin and insects, including swarms and giant varieties, within 120 feet via pheromone transmission. In a hive, this range extends to cover the entire hive. This is a silent and instantaneous mode of communication that only Arbeyach, spawn of Arbeyach, insects, and vermin can understand. All these creatures follow Arbeyach\'s orders and will never harm the devil.

Bite:
Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with Arbeyach rot. The cursed target is poisoned, can\'t regain hit points, its hit point maximum decreases by 13 (3d8) for every 24 hours that elapse, and vermin attack the creature on sight. If the curse reduces the target\'s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies and immediately transforms into a randomly chosen swarm of insects. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or comparable magic.

Claw:
Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d8 + 6) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage.

Vermin Breath (Recharge 5-6):
Arbeyach exhales vermin in a 120-foot line that\'s 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line takes 54 (12d8) poison damage, or half damage with a successful DC 22 Dexterity saving throw. Each creature that fails this saving throw must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with Arbeyach rot (see the Bite attack). In addition, Arbeyach summons a swarm of insects (of any type) at any point of the line. The swarm remains until destroyed, until Arbeyach dismisses it as a bonus action, or for 2 minutes. No more than five swarms of insects can be summoned at the same time.

When an arcanaphage dies, it explodes in a surge of partially-digested magical energy.

For 1 minute afterward, the affected area is awash with volatile magic. A creature that starts its turn in the affected area takes 7 (2d6) force damage.

Hunger:
Each time it feeds in combat, it regains hp equal to twice the level of the spell it ate and increases its Feed score by 1. The arcanaphage can’t have a Feed score higher than 8, and its Feed score reduces by 1 each time it finishes a long rest.

Ingest Magic:
At the start of each of the arcanaphage’s turns, each creature within 30 feet of it that is currently maintaining concentration on a spell must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature’s spell ends and the arcanaphage feeds.

Magic Immunity:
The arcanaphage is immune to damage from spells. It has advantage on saving throws against all other magical effects.

Claw:
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage.

Ash Cloud:
An ash drake can beat its wings and create a cloud of ash that extends 10 feet in all directions, centered on itself. This cloud provides half cover, though the ash drake can see normally through its own cloud. Any creature that enters or starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1d6 rounds.

Ash Breath (recharge 6):
An ash drake spews a 20-foot cone of blistering hot, choking ash. Any targets in the path of this spray takes 14 (4d6) fire damage and become poisoned for one minute; a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw reduces damage by half and negates the poisoning. A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.

On a failure, the astral snapper consumes part of the host’s internal organs, reducing the host’s Constitution score by 1d4. The host dies if this reduces its Constitution to 0. The reduction lasts until the host finishes a long rest after the astral snapper has been expelled.

The astral snapper becomes completely corporeal as it exits the host, stepping out of the host at its full size.

From the time the astral snapper succeeds on the initial dive into the host through the Astral Plane until the moment it emerges from the host’s abdomen, it can be seen by any creature that can see into the Astral Plane—its head buried in the host’s back.

Claw:
Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.

Whip:
Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d8 + 7) slashing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 17) and restrained.

Punishing Maw:
If a target is already grappled in a whip at the start of the automata devil\'s turn, both creatures make opposed Strength (Athletics) checks. If the grappled creature wins, it takes 9 (2d8) piercing damage and remains grappled. If the devil wins, the grappled creature is dragged into the devil\'s stomach maw, a mass of churning gears, razor teeth, and whirling blades. The creature takes 49 (4d20 + 7) slashing damage and is grappled, and the whip is free to attack again on the devil\'s next turn. The creature takes another 49 (4d20 +7) slashing damage automatically at the start of each of the automata devil\'s turns for as long as it remains grappled in the maw. Only one creature can be grappled in the punishing maw at a time. The automata devil can freely "spit out"a creature or corpse during its turn, to free up the maw for another victim.

Fear Aura:
Automata devils radiate fear in a 10-foot radius. A creature that starts its turn in the affected area must make a successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. A creature that makes the save successfully cannot be affected by the same automata devil\'s fear aura again.

When the avatar damages a creature, it absorbs a portion of that creature’s knowledge and power. As a bonus action, it can recreate any action available to a creature it damaged within the last minute. This includes spells and actions with limited uses or with a recharge. This recreated action is resolved using the avatar’s statistics where applicable.

Amorphous:
The avatar, including its equipment, can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day):
If the avatar fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Soothing Aura:
Any creature hostile to the avatar that starts its turn within 30 feet of the avatar must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on all attack rolls until the end of its next turn. Creatures with Intelligence 3 or lower automatically fail the saving throw.

Innate Spellcasting (Psionics):
The avatar’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell casting DC 21, +13 to hit with spell attacks). It may cast the following spells innately, requiring no components:
At will: acid splash (4d6), light, spare the dying, true strike
3/day each: bless, blur, command, darkness, enthrall, shield
2/day each: counterspell, dispel magic

Legendary Merge:
A shoth with less than half its maximum hp can merge with any other shoth creature within 10 feet, adding its remaining hp to that creature’s. The hp gained this way can exceed the normal maximum of that creature. The avatar can accept any number of such mergers.

Acid Wave (Recharge 5-6):
The avatar rises up and crashes down, releasing a 20-foot radius wave of acidic ooze. Each creature in the area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 67 (15d8) acid damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone.

Consult the Zom (1/Day):
The avatar uses its action to consult its weighty zom for insight. The zom flashes brilliant crimson-and-white light. Each creature within 120 feet who can see the avatar must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. Each creature of the avatar’s choice within 120 feet that speaks a language must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn as the avatar telepathically utters a short expression that is particularly meaningful to that creature.

Whip:
Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 25 feet toward the balor.

Teleport:
The balor magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day):
The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.
A balor has a 50 percent chance of summoning 1d8 vrocks, 1d6 hezrous, 1d4 glabrezus, 1d3 nalfeshnees, 1d2 mariliths, or one goristro.
A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can\'t summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

Regeneration (Alternate Form only):
The Bear King regains 10 hit points at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 hit point.

Bear King\'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Bear King takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Bear King can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:- The Bear King magically conjures up a swarm of eight giant bees (use giant wasp statistics) to defend his lair. The bees act immediately, and on initiative count 20 in subsequent rounds. The bees remain until they’re killed or until the Bear King dismisses them as an action. The Bear King can use this action again, but no more than eight giant bees can be present at a time. - The Bear King targets a creature within the lair that he can see. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be magically transformed into a brown bear as if by a polymorph spell. At the beginning of its turn, a transformed creature repeats the saving throw. If it fails, the creature must use its action to attack one of the Bear King’s foes. If it succeeds, the effect ends and the creature returns to its normal form. The effect lasts until the creature succeeds on the saving throw or until the Bear King uses this lair action again.- The Bear King causes the ground in a 20-foot radius to tremble and shake. Any creatures in the affected area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or suffer 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and fall prone. The ground continues to tremble until initiative count 20 on the following round, during which time the area is difficult terrain.

Regional Effects:
the region surrounding Gloaming Crag is warped by the Bear King’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:- Within 10 miles of the Bear King’s lair, creatures have disadvantage on saving throws made to avoid contracting lycanthropy from a werebear.- Bees within 10 miles of the Bear King’s lair are easily agitated quick to attack. Insect swarms (bees or hornets) are common in the area, but they tend to ignore locals.- Emotions within 5 miles of the Bear King’s lair run high. Arguments quickly descend into physical scuffles and enjoyable get-togethers are likely to become raucous carousing or even brawls.if the Bear King dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d6 days.

Each creature in the elemental’s space must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and, if it is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13). A grappled creature is restrained and unable to breathe. If the saving throw is successful, the creature is pushed out of the elemental’s space. The elemental can grapple one Large creature or up to two Medium or smaller creatures at one time.

At the start of the elemental’s turn, each target grappled by it takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. A creature within 5 feet of the elemental can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing a grappled creature on a success. When Blood Drain deals 30 or more necrotic damage, the elemental grows in size as though affected by an enlarge/reduce spell.

The blood giant uses one of the following:
Impale. The blood giant causes 10-foot-high blood spikes to burst from the ground within 15 feet of it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 26 (4d12) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Drown. The blood giant sends blood pouring down the throat of one creature within 30 feet, which must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is incapacitated until the end of its next turn as it coughs up the blood and is poisoned for 1 minute after that.
Vaporize. A red mist surrounds the blood giant in a 20-foot-radius sphere. The mist spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It moves with the blood giant and doesn’t impede the giant’s vision. The mist dissipates after 1d4 rounds.

The blood hag makes two claw attacks and one blood-drinking hair attack.

Blood-Drinking Hair:
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage and a Medium or smaller target is grappled (escape DC 15). A grappled creature takes 13 (2d8 + 3) necrotic damage at the start of the hag\'s turns, and the hag heals half as many hit points. The hag gains excess healing as temporary hit points. The hag can grapple one or two creatures at a time. Also see Face Peel.

Claws:
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (4d6 + 5) slashing damage.

Call the Blood:
The blood hag targets a living creature within 30 feet that she detects with her blood sense and makes the target bleed uncontrollably. The target must make a successful DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer one of the effects listed below. A target that saves successfully cannot be affected by this hag\'s ability again for 24 hours.

1:
Blood Choke Curse. The target\'s mouth fills with blood, preventing any speech or spellcasting with verbal components for 1 minute.

2:
Blood Eye. The target\'s eyes well up with bloody tears. The target is blinded for 1 minute.

3:
Heart Like Thunder. The target hears only the rushing of blood and their thumping heart. They are deaf for 1 minute.

4:
Rupturing Arteries. The victim suffers 7 (2d6) slashing damage as its veins and arteries burst open. The target repeats the saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns. It takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage if the saving throw fails, but the effect ends on a successful save.

Face Peel:
The blood hag peels the face off one grappled foe. The target must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the face is torn off; the target takes 38 (8d6 + 10) slashing damage and is stunned until the start of the hag\'s next turn. If the save succeeds, the target takes half damage and isn\'t stunned. Heal, regeneration, or comparable magic restores the stolen features; other curative magic forms a mass of scar tissue. The peeled-off face is a tiny, animated object (per the spell-20 HP, AC 18, no attack, Str 4, Dex 18) under the hag\'s control. It retains the former owner\'s memories and personality. Blood hags keep such faces as trophies, but they can also wear someone\'s face to gain advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to imitate the face\'s former owner.

A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw every four hours, taking another 1d6 Charisma damage for each failure, until it has made two consecutive successful saves or survived for 24 hours.

White Ghost Shivers:
A living creature that is injured by or makes physical contact with a creature carrying the white ghost shivers must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw at the end of the encounter to avoid becoming infected. This disease manifests after 24 hours, beginning as a mild chill, but increasingly severe after a day, accompanied by a fever. Hallucinations are common, and the fright they induce lends the disease its name. At onset, the infected creature gains two levels of exhaustion that cannot be removed until the disease is cured by lesser restoration, comparable magic, or rest. The infected creature makes another DC 11 Constitution saving throw at the end of each long rest; a successful save removes one level of exhaustion. If the saving throw fails, the disease persists. If both levels of exhaustion are removed by successful saving throws, the victim has recovered naturally.

the cambium\'s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). The cambium can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

constant: levitate

at will: alter self, detect thoughts, hold person, plane shift, spare the dying

3/day: cure wounds 21 (4d8 + 3), ray of sickness 18 (4d8), protection from poison, heal

1/day: finger of death

The cambium makes four needle fingers attacks.

Needle Fingers:
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage. In addition, the target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw; if it fails, the cambium can either inflict Ability Damage or Imbalance Humors. A target makes this saving throw just once per turn, even if struck by more than one needle fingers attack.

Ability Damage (3/Day):
When the target of the cambium\'s needle fingers fails its Constitution saving throw, one of its ability scores (cambium\'s choice) is reduced by 1d4 until it finishes a long rest. If this reduces a score to 0, the creature is unconscious until it regains at least one point.

Imbalance Humors (3/Day):
When the target of the cambium\'s needle fingers fails its Constitution saving throw, apply one of the following effects:

Sanguine Flux: The target cannot be healed:
aturally or magically.until after their next long rest.

Choleric Flux: The target becomes confused (as the spell) for 3d6 rounds:
The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to shrug off the flux before the duration ends.

Melancholic Flux: The target is incapacitated for 1d4 rounds and slowed (as the spell) for 3d6 rounds:
The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to shrug off the flux before the duration ends.

Phlegmatic Flux: A successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw negates this effect:
A failed saving throw means the target gains one level of exhaustion which lasts for 3d6 rounds.

Animate Chains (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):
Up to four chains the devil can see within 60 feet of it magically sprout razor-edged barbs and animate under the devil\'s control, provided that the chains aren\'t being worn or carried.
Each animated chain is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. When the devil uses Multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated chain to make one additional chain attack. An animated chain can grapple one creature of its own but can\'t make attacks while grappling. An animated chain reverts to its inanimate state if reduced to 0 hit points or if the devil is incapacitated or dies.

The chelicerae has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Spellcasting:
the chelicerae is an 8th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It requires no material components to cast its spells. The chelicerae has the following wizard spells prepared:

cantrips: acid splash, mage hand, minor illusion, true strike

1st level: burning hands, detect magic, expeditious retreat, ray of sickness

2nd level: hold person, invisibility, scorching ray

3rd level: animate dead, haste, lightning bolt

4th level: phantasmal killer

Siphon Spell Slots:
The chelicerae cannot replenish its spells naturally. Instead, it uses grappled spellcasters as spell reservoirs, draining uncast spells to power its own casting. Whenever the chelicerae wishes to cast a spell, it consumes a number of spell slots from its victim equal to the spell slots necessary to cast the spell. If the victim has too few spell slots available, the chelicerae cannot cast that spell. The chelicerae can also draw power from drained spellcasters or creatures without magic ability. It can reduce a grappled creature\'s Wisdom by 1d4, adding 2 spell slots to its spell reservoir for every point lowered. A creature reduced to 0 Wisdom is unconscious until it regains at least one point, and can\'t offer any more power. A creature regains all lost Wisdom when it finishes a long rest.

Spider Climb:
Chelicerae can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without requiring an ability check.

A cipactli sings a soporific, primordial song of eternal rest and divine repose from its many mouths.

Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can\'t see or if it relies on senses other than sight.
A duplicate has the cloaker\'s AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

Immutable Form:
The assassin is immune to any spell or effect, other than its disassembly trait, that would alter its form.

Magic Resistance:
The assassin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Psychic Susceptibility:
If the assassin takes psychic damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

Sneak Attack (1/Turn):
The assassin deals an extra 10 (3d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the assassin that isn’t incapacitated and the assassin doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

Disassembly:
The assassin breaks its body down into a snakelike, segmented cylinder, which allows it to move through a space as narrow as 6 inches wide. It can reassemble itself into its true form by using this action again. While disassembled into its snake form, the assassin can’t attack and attack rolls against it have advantage.

Creatures that are within 20 feet of the corpse mound at the end of its turn must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of their next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the Noxious Aura for 24 hours.

Zombie Drop:
At the start of the corpse mound\'s turn during combat, one corpse falls from the mound onto the ground and immediately rises as a zombie under its control. Up to 10 such zombies can be active at one time. Zombies take their turns immediately after the corpse mound\'s turn.

Bone Shard:
Ranged Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) piercing damage and 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. When hit, the target must make a successful DC 17 Strength check or be knocked prone, pinned to the ground by the shard, and restrained. To end this restraint, the target or a creature adjacent to it must use an action to make a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check to remove the shard.

Envelop:
The corpse mound makes a slam attack against a restrained creature. If the attack hits, the target takes damage as normal, is pulled 5 feet into the corpse mound\'s space, and is enveloped, which ends any grappled or prone condition. While enveloped, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the corpse mound, and it takes 21 (6d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the corpse mound\'s turns. An enveloped creature can escape by using its action to make a successful DC 17 Strength saving throw. If the corpse mound takes 30 or more damage on a single turn from the enveloped creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or expel the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the corpse mound. If the corpse mound dies, an enveloped creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone. A corpse mound can envelop up to 4 creatures at once.

Forbiddance. The crimson mist can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
Harmed by Running Water. The crimson mist takes 20 force damage if it ends its turn above or within running water.

The mist moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter a Medium or smaller creature’s space. When the mist enters a creature’s space, the creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

On a failed save, the mist enters the creature’s space, and the creature takes 15 (4d6) necrotic damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, and takes 15 (4d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the mist’s turns. When the mist moves, the engulfed creature doesn’t move with it, and is freed. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 14 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the mist. A creature within 5 feet of the mist can take an action to pull a creature out of the mist. Doing so requires a DC 14 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. The mist can only engulf one Medium or smaller creature at a time.

A darakhul in a prepared disguise has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass as a living creature. While using this ability, the darakhul loses its stench.

Shadow Stealth:
While in dim light or darkness, the darakhul shadowmancer can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

Stench:
Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the darakhul must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the darakhul’s Stench for the next 24 hours. A darakhul shadowmancer using this ability can’t also benefit from Master of Disguise.

Sunlight Sensitivity:
While in sunlight, the darakhul has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Turning Defiance:
The darakhul shadowmancer and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

Spellcasting:
The darakhul shadowmancer is a 9th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following wizard spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): acid splash, chill touch, mage hand, prestidigitation
1st level (4 slots): mage armor, ray of sickness, silent image
2nd level (3 slots): misty step, scorching ray, see invisibility
3rd level (3 slots): animate dead, dispel magic, stinking cloud
4th level (2 slots): arcane eye, black tentacles, confusion
5th level (1 slot): teleportation circle

While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle\'s speed also becomes 0, it can\'t benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target.
A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13 Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.

Darkness Aura (1/day):
A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can\'t penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.

The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest.

Tangible Illusion (1/Day):
After casting an illusion spell of an object, the dau temporarily transforms that illusion into a physical, nonmagical object. The temporary object lasts 10 minutes, after which it reverts to being an illusion (or vanishes, if the duration of the original illusion expires). During that time, the illusion has all the physical properties of the object it represents, but not magical properties. The dau must touch the illusion to trigger this transformation, and the object can be no larger than 5 cubic feet.

Incorporeal Movement:
The deathwisp can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside a solid object.

Shadow Jump:
A deathwisp can travel between shadows as if by means of dimension door. This magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. A shadow fey can jump up to a total of 40 feet per day; this may be a single jump of 40 feet, four jumps of 10 feet each, etc. This ability must be used in 10-foot increments.

Sunlight Sensitivity:
While in sunlight, the deathwisp has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Unnatural Aura:
Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a deathwisp, unless a master makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.

The deathwisp targets a humanoid within 10 feet of it that died violently less than 1 minute ago. The target\'s spirit rises as a wraith in the space of its corpse or in the nearest unoccupied space. This wraith is under the deathwisp\'s control. The deathwisp can keep no more than five wraiths under its control at one time.

Rock:
Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 29 (4d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

Earthstrike (Recharge 4-6):
The degenerate titan slams his fists onto the ground, creating a shockwave in a line 60 feet long and 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line takes 35 (10d6) force damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the titan and knocked prone; a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage and prevents the creature from being flung or knocked prone. A creature that\'s flung against an unyielding object such as a wall or floor takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If it collides with another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage (1d6 bludgeoning per 10 feet) and be knocked prone.

Shout of the Void (Recharge 4-6):
The degenerate titan utters a scream that rends reality in a 30-foot cone. Any ongoing spell or magical effect of 3rd level or lower in the area ends. For every spell or effect of 4th level or higher in the area, the degenerate titan makes a Constitution check against DC (10 + the level of the spell or effect). On a success, the spell or effect ends.

The iron cage that holds the fetal savant provides cover for the creature. The cage (AC 19, 10 hp) is considered an equipped object when borne by a derro and cannot be attacked directly. In addition, the cage protects the occupant from up to 20 spell levels of spells 4th level or lower but provides no protection to those outside of the cage. Spells of level 5 or higher take full, normal effect against the cage and its occupant. Once the cage protects against 20 or more spell levels it is rendered non-magical. If exposed to direct sunlight for over one hour of cumulative time it is destroyed.

Madness:
A derro fetal savant\'s particular madness grants it immunity to psychic effects. It cannot be restored to sanity by any means short of a wish spell or comparable magic. A derro fetal savant brought to sanity gains 4 points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma.

Vulnerability to Sunlight:
A derro fetal savant takes 1 point of Constitution damage for every hour it is exposed to sunlight, and it dies if its Constitution score reaches 0. Lost Constitution points are recovered at the rate of 1/day spent underground or otherwise sheltered from the sun.

',
                    'attacks' => 'Babble:
The sight of potential host bodies so excites the fetal savant that it babbles and giggles madly and childishly, creating an insanity effect. All sane creatures that start their turns within 60 feet of the fetal savant must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be affected by confusion (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds. This is a psychic effect. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same fetal savant\'s babbling for 24 hours. This action cannot be taken when the fetal savant is using Soul Exchange.

Soul Exchange:
As an action, the fetal savant can attempt to take control of a creature it can see within 90 feet, forcing an exchange of souls as a magic jar spell, using its own body as the container. The fetal savant can use this power at will, but it can exchange souls with only one other creature at a time. The victim resists the attack with a successful DC 13 Charisma saving throw. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the same fetal savant\'s soul exchange for 24 hours. If the saving throw fails, the fetal savant takes control of the target\'s body and ferociously attacks nearby opponents, eyes blazing with otherworldly light. As an action, the fetal savant can shift from its host body back to its own, if it is within range, returning the victim\'s soul to its own body. If the host body or fetal savant is brought to 0 hit points within 90 feet of each other, the two souls return to their original bodies and the creature at 0 hit points is dying; it must make death saving throws until it dies, stabilizes, or regains hit points, as usual. If the host body or fetal savant is slain while they are more than 90 feet apart, their souls cannot return to their bodies and they are both slain. While trapped in the fetal savant\'s withered body, the victim is effectively paralyzed and helpless.

If the desert troll burrows at least 15 feet straight toward a creature, it can burst out of the ground, harming those above it. Each creature in its space when it erupts must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage, is pushed out of the troll’s space, and is knocked prone. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and is pushed out of the troll’s space, but isn’t knocked prone.

Keen Smell:
The desert troll has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

Regeneration:
The troll regains 10 hp at the start of its turn. If the troll takes acid damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the troll’s next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn’t regenerate.

Water Susceptibility:
The desert troll takes 1 acid damage for every 5 feet it moves in water or for every gallon of water splashed on it.

In a new form, the deva retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.

Shortbow:
Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature that is grappled by the dhampir, incapactitated, or restrained. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The dhampir commander regains hp equal to the amount of necrotic damage dealt.

Predatory Charm:
The dhampir magically beguiles the mind of one humanoid it can see within 30 feet for 1 hour.

If it uses its Predatory Charm on another target, the effect on the previous target ends.

Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):
For 1 minute, the dhampir can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the dhampir. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the dhampir is incapacitated.

Innate Spellcasting:
The djinni\'s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: detect evil and good, detect magic, thunderwave
3/day each: create food and water (can create wine instead of water), tongues, wind walk
1/day each: conjure elemental (air elemental only), creation, gaseous form, invisibility, major image, plane shift

Variant: Genie Powers:
Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.

**Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.
**Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn\'t a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can\'t grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature\'s existence.
To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature\'s behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie\'s nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish\'s poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie\'s benefit.

Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.
A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage.

Arcane Doubling (recharges after 10 minutes):
A doppelrat under duress creates clones of itself at the beginning of its turn. Each round for 4 rounds, the number of live doppelrats quadruples but never exceeds 20. For example, when the doppelrat triggers arcane doubling, 1 rat becomes 4; at the start of the rat\'s next turn, those 4 become 16; and at the start of the rat\'s third turn, those 16 become 20, the maximum allowed. If one of the duplicates was destroyed between the original doppelrat\'s 1st and 2nd turns, then the surviving 3 would become 12, and so on. Each duplicate appears in the same space as any other rat, can either move or take an action the round it appears, and has 4 hit points and AC 13. Any surviving duplicates perish 1 minute (10 rounds) after the first ones were created. If the original doppelrat dies, its clones stop duplicating but the preexisting clones remain until their time expires. A creature can identify the original doppelrat from its duplicates as an action by making a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Perception) check.

Doppeling Disease:
At the end of a dopplerat encounter, every creature bitten by a doppelrat or its duplicates must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract the degenerate cloning disease. During each long rest, the diseased creature grows and sloughs off a stillborn clone. The doppeling process leaves the diseased creature incapacitated for 1 hour, unable to move and barely able to speak (spellcasting is impossible in this state). When the incapacitation wears off, the creature makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw; it recovers from the disease when it makes its second successful save. Humanoid clones created by the disease cannot be brought to life in any manner.

A creature that ends its turn grappled by a dream eater is restrained until the end of its next turn, it takes 5 (1d4 + 3) psychic damage, and the dream eater gains the same number of temporary hit points.

Lotus Scent (Recharge 6):
The dream eater secretes an oily chemical that most creatures find intoxicating. All living creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw against poison or be poisoned for 2d4 rounds. While poisoned this way, the creature is stunned. Creatures that successfully save are immune to that dream eater\'s lotus scent for 24 hours.

Waking Dreams (1/Day):
Every creature within 20 feet of the dream eater must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. Those that fail enter waking dreams and are confused (as the spell) for 6 rounds. On turns when the creature can act normally (rolls 9 or 10 for the confusion effect), it can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, and the effect ends early on a successful save.

If a target\'s saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad\'s Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.

the dullahan\'s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The dullahan can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material or somatic components:

at will: bane, chill touch, hex, knock

The dullahan points at a creature marked by Deathly Doom within 40 feet than it can see. The creature must succeed at a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against this magic or immediately drop to 0 hit points. A creature that successfully saves is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

Adhesive (Object or Terrain Form Only):
The dune mimic adheres to anything that touches it. A creature adhered to the dune mimic is also grappled by it (escape DC 15). Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. The dune mimic can harden its outer surface, so only the creatures it chooses are affected by this trait.

Engulf:
The dune mimic engulfs all creatures it has grappled. An engulfed creature can\'t breathe, is restrained, is no longer grappled, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the dune mimic, and takes 18 (4d8) acid damage at the start of each of the dune mimic\'s turns. When the dune mimic moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the dune mimic.

The dryad is mystically bonded to her duskthorn vines and must remain within 300 yards of them or become poisoned.

Ring Magic:
The dwarven ringmage can imbue a nonmagical ring with a spell that has a range of self or touch. Doing so expends components as if the dwarven ringmage had cast the spell normally and uses a spell slot one level higher than the spell normally requires. When the wearer of the ring activates the ring as an action, the spell is cast as if the dwarven ringmage had cast the spell. The dwarven ringmage does not regain the spell slot until the ring is discharged or the dwarven ringmage chooses to dismiss the spell.

Ring-Staff Focus:
The dwarven ringmage can use his ring-staff as a focus for spells that require rings as a focus or component, or for his Ring Magic ability. If used as a focus for Ring Magic, the spell does not require a spell slot one level higher than the spell normally requires. Once per day, the dwarven ringmage can imbue a spell of 4th level or lower into his ring-staff by expending a spell slot equal to the spell being imbued.

Spellcasting:
the mage is a 9th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The mage has the following wizard spells prepared:

cantrips (at will): fire bolt, mage hand, shocking grasp, true strike

2nd level (3 slots): misty step, web

If the efreeti dies, its body disintegrates in a flash of fire and puff of smoke, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying.

At will: detect magic
3/day: enlarge/reduce, tongues
1/day each: conjure elemental (fire elemental only), gaseous form, invisibility, major image, plane shift, wall of fire

Variant: Genie Powers:
Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.

**Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.
**Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn\'t a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can\'t grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature\'s existence.
To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature\'s behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie\'s nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish\'s poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie\'s benefit.

The elemental locus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Immortal:
The elemental locus does not age and does not die when it drops to 0 hit points. If the elemental locus drops to 0 hit points, it falls into a quiescent state for 25 weeks before returning to activity with full hit points. Its spawned elementals continue fighting whatever enemies attacked the elemental locus; if no enemies are present, they defend the locus\'s area.

Massive:
The elemental locus is larger than most Gargantuan creatures, occupying a space of 60 by 60 feet. Its movement is not affected by difficult terrain or by Huge or smaller creatures. Other creatures can enter and move through the elemental locus\'s space, but they must make a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check after each 10 feet of movement. Failure indicates they fall prone and can move no farther that turn.

Spawn Elementals:
As a bonus action, the elemental locus loses 82 hit points and spawns an air, earth, fire, or water elemental to serve it. Spawned elementals answer to their creator\'s will and are not fully independent. The types of elementals the locus can spawn depend on the terrain it embodies; for example, an elemental locus of the desert can spawn earth, fire, and air elementals, but not water.

Siege Monster:
The elemental locus deals double damage to objects and structures.

War Mage:
When making an opportunity attack, the dragonborn can cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action instead of making a weapon attack.

When the elophar takes damage other than acid damage, corrosive ectoplasm bursts from its distended stomach.

Possessed by Ancestors:
The chaos of combat causes an elophar to swap between personalities at the start of each of its turns. To determine which spirit is in control, roll on the table below (it is possible for one spirit to remain in control for multiple rounds if it is rolled multiple rounds in a row):
| 1d6 | Spirit |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Cautious: creates space between itself and its enemies and casts spells. |
| 2 | Fickle: attacks a creature it didn’t last round. |
| 3 | Terrified: uses the Disengage action to run as far away from enemies as possible. |
| 4 | Bloodthirsty: attacks the nearest creature. |
| 5 | Hateful: only attacks the last creature it damaged. |
| 6 | Courageous: makes melee attacks against the most threatening enemy. |

Runic Spellcasting:
The runes etched on the elophar’s rotting skin allow it to cast spells. The elophar’s runic spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). The elophar can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: acid splash, chill touch, poison spray
3/day: grease, thunderwave
1/day: enlarge/reduce

Emperor Of The Ghouls\' Lair Actions:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Emperor takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. The Emperor can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Until initiative count 20 on the following round, all creatures other than undead and constructs who take necrotic damage take an additional 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

- The emperor targets a creature within 30 feet that he can see. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. The emperor regains hit points equal to the damage.

- A wall of ice springs up from a surface within 100 feet of the emperor. The wall is 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. A creature in the wall’s space when it appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) cold damage; then the creature is pushed to either side of the wall (the creature’s choice). Each 5-foot section of the wall has AC 10, 15 hit points, resistance to piercing and slashing damage, immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. The wall lasts until the emperor uses this action again, or dies.

Regional Effects:
the region around the emperor’s lair is warped by its magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Creatures within 1 mile of the lair who are infected with darakhul fever have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against spells and effects generated by ghouls or darakhul.

- Dead bodies within 1 mile of the lair have an 80 percent chance to reanimate as skeletons or zombies 24 hours after their death. These undead never attack ghouls or dharakul, but instinctively obey their commands.

- Phantom lights appear within 10 miles of the lair, more frequently the closer they are to the lair. The lights shed dim light out to 10 feet. Undead within such a light gain 1d6 temporary hit points at the start of their turn; the light can’t raise an undead’s hit points above 150 percent of its normal hit point maximum.

if the emperor dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.

Spellcasting:
The enchanter is a 13th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The enchanter has the following wizard spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): dancing lights, friends, mage hand, message, prestidigitation
1st level (4 slots): charm person*, hideous laughter*, magic missile
2nd level (3 slots): hold person*, invisibility, suggestion*
3rd level (3 slots): hypnotic pattern, lightning bolt

Captivating Gaze:
The enchanter targets a creature within 30 feet of it who can see or hear the enchanter. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. The charmed target’s speed is reduced to 0, it is incapacitated, and it must spend each round looking at the enchanter. While looking at the enchanter, the charmed target is considered blinded to other creatures not between it and the enchanter. The charmed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the charmed target takes damage from one of the enchanter’s allies, it has advantage on the next saving throw. The effect also ends if the creature can no longer see or hear the enchanter. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the enchanter’s Captivating Gaze for the next 24 hours.

Time Warping Staff:
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

Drift Backward (1/Day):
A future self of the eonic drifter materializes in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the drifter. The future self has the eonic drifter\'s stats and its full hit points, and it takes its turn immediately after its present self. Killing the original eonic drifter makes its future self disappear. If the present self sees its future self die, the eonic drifter must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. There is no effect if the save succeeds. If the saving throw fails, roll 1d6 to determine the effect on the eonic drifter: 1 = frightened, 2 = incapacitated, 3 = paralyzed, 4 = unconscious, 5 or 6 = has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. These effects last 1d4 rounds.

Drift Forward (2/Day):
The future self makes a time warping staff attack against a target. If the attack hits, instead of causing bludgeoning damage, both the target and the attacker jump forward through time, effectively ceasing to exist in the present time. They reappear in the same locations 1d4 rounds later, at the end of the present self\'s turn. Creatures occupying those locations at that moment are pushed 5 feet in a direction of their own choosing. The target of the drift (but not the future self) must then make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, with effects identical to those for the eonic drifter witnessing the death of its future self (see Drift Backward). The future self doesn\'t reappear after using this ability the second time; only the target of the drift reappears from the second use. This does not trigger a saving throw for the present self.

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the worg can’t bite another target.

Might of the Great Wolf (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):
The fang of the Great Wolf grows in size. This works like the enlarge/reduce spell, except the worg can only enlarge and it lasts for 1 minute. While enlarged, the fang of the Great Wolf gains the following action:
Swallow. The worg makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worg, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the worg’s turns. The worg can have only one creature swallowed at a time.

If the worg takes 10 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the worg must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the worg. The creature is automatically regurgitated when the worg is no longer enlarged. If the worg dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.

Those who meet the gaze of the fear smith experience the world seeming to twist at unnatural angles beneath their feet. When a creature that can see the fear smith\'s eye starts its turn within 30 feet of the fear smith, the creature must make a successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become disoriented. While disoriented, the creature falls prone each time it tries to move or take the Dash or Disengage action. To recover from disorientation, a creature must start its turn outside the fear smith\'s gaze and make a successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. To use this ability, the fear smith can\'t be incapacitated and must see the affected creature. A creature that isn\'t surprised can avert its eyes at the start of its turn to avoid the effect. In that case, no saving throw is necessary but the creature treats the fear smith as invisible until the start of the creature\'s next turn. If during its turn the creature chooses to look at the fear smith, it must immediately make the saving throw.

Hidden Eye:
The fear smith has advantage on saving throws against the blinded condition.

the fear smith\'s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). The fear smith can innately cast the following spells, requiring no verbal or material components:at will: detect thoughts, fear2/day each: charm person, command, confusion

Thrall Enslavement:
The fierstjerren targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it that has a CR up to 1/2. The humanoid must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the fierstjerren. The fierstjerren can telepathically communicate with any creature it has charmed. The charmed target can’t take reactions and obeys the fierstjerren’s verbal and telepathic commands. A fierstjerren can have up to twelve charmed thralls at one time. A charmed thrall loses the memories of its previous life and devotes itself to the fierstjerren and the cult. The charm lasts for 24 hours or until the fierstjerren is destroyed, is more than 300 feet from the charmed target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. The fierstjerren can attempt to reassert control over all of its thralls by using this action. Each thrall can repeat the saving throw when the fierstjerren uses this action to reassert control.

Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see.

The golem\'s creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.

Aversion of Fire:
If the golem takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

Immutable Form:
The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

Lightning Absorption:
Whenever the golem is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.

The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Horrifying Visage:
Each non-undead creature within 60 ft. of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 x 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success.

The aging effect can be reversed with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.

Possession (Recharge 6):
One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 ft. of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn\'t deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can\'t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target\'s statistics, but doesn\'t gain access to the target\'s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost\'s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

Condition Immunities paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, stunned. The ghostwalk ends when the spider chooses to end it as a bonus action or when the spider dies

Incorporeal Movement (During Ghostwalk Only):
The ghostwalk spider can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

Spider Climb:
The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned and paralyzed for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points. While using Ghostwalk, the spider\'s bite and poison do half damage to targets that aren\'t affected by Ghostly Snare (see below).

Ghostly Snare (During Ghostwalk Only, Recharge 5-6):
Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 40/160 ft., one target. Hit: The target is restrained by ghostly webbing. While restrained in this way, the target is invisible to all creatures except ghostwalk spiders, and it has resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage. A creature restrained by Ghostly Snare can escape by using an action to make a successful DC 14 Strength check, or the webs can be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5).

A darakhul in a prepared disguise has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass as a living creature. While using this ability, the darakhul loses its stench.

Stench:
Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the darakhul must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. A successful saving throw makes the creature immune to the darakhul\'s stench for 24 hours. A darakhul using this ability can\'t also benefit from Master of Disguise.

Sunlight Sensitivity:
The darakhul has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on attack rolls while it, the object it is trying to see or attack in direct sunlight.

Turning Defiance:
The darakhul and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

Darakhul Fever:
spread mainly through bite wounds, this rare disease makes itself known within 24 hours by swiftly debilitating the infected. A creature so afflicted must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw after every long rest. On a failed save the victim takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction can\'t be removed until the victim recovers from darakhul fever, and even then only by greater restoration or similar magic. The victim recovers from the disease by making successful saving throws on two consecutive days. Greater restoration cures the disease; lesser restoration allows the victim to make the daily Constitution check with advantage. Primarily spread among humanoids, the disease can affect ogres, and therefore other giants may be susceptible. If the infected creature dies while infected with darakhul fever, roll 1d20, add the character\'s current Constitution modifier, and find the result on the Adjustment Table to determine what undead form the victim\'s body rises in. Adjustment Table Roll Result:

1-9 None; victim is simply dead

The giant shark bowl has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn’t have all its hp.

Electrical Charge:
When the giant shark bowl is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead becomes charged for 1 minute. While charged, its attacks deal an extra 2 (1d4) lightning damage.

Ooze Fish Bowl:
The shark bowl takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but they are subjected to the bowl’s Engulf and have disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures inside the bowl can be seen but have total cover. A creature within 5 feet of the bowl can take an action to pull a creature out. Doing so requires a successful DC 15 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage. The bowl can hold one Large creature or up to six Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.

Pseudopod:
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

Engulf:
The giant shark bowl moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures’ spaces. Whenever the bowl enters a creature’s space, the creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw.

On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the bowl. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.

On a failed save, the bowl enters the creature’s space, and the creature takes 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, and takes 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage at the start of each of the bowl’s turns. When the bowl moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.

An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the bowl.

A gilded devil\'s attacks ignore any protection provided by nonmagical armor made of bronze, iron, steel, or similar metals. Protection provided by valuable metals such as adamantine, mithral, and gold apply, as do bonuses provided by non-metallic objects.

Scourge of Avarice:
As a bonus action, a gilded devil wearing jewelry worth at least 1,000 gp can reshape it into a +2 heavy flail. A creature struck by this jeweled flail suffers disadvantage on all Wisdom saving throws until his or her next short rest, in addition to normal weapon damage. The flail reverts to its base components 1 minute after it leaves the devil\'s grasp, or upon the gilded devil\'s death.

Voracious Greed:
As an action, a gilded devil can consume nonmagical jewelry or coinage worth up to 1,000 gp. For each 200 gp consumed, it heals 5 hp of damage. A gilded devil can use this ability against the worn items of a grappled foe. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to keep an item from being consumed.

Innate Spellcasting:
The hag\'s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery

Mimicry:
The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.

Hag Coven:
When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.
A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.

Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only):
While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard\'s spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:

• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness
• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object
• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt
• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph
• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying
• 6th level (1 slot): eye bite

For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag\'s Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag\'s Intelligence modifier.

Hag Eye (Coven Only):
A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.
A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can\'t perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

                    'attacks' => 'Claws:
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

Illusory Appearance:
The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.
The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

Invisible Passage:
The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.

As a bonus action, the green knight targets one creature that it can see within 30 feet and issues a challenge.

The jester performs an ancient, nihilistic joke of necromantic power. This joke has no effect on undead or constructs. All other creatures within 60 feet of the jester must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail fall prone in a fit of deadly laughter. The laughter lasts 1d4 rounds, during which time the victim is incapacitated and unable to stand up from prone. At the end of its turn each round, an incapacitated victim must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be reduced to 0 hit points.

A creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a creature\'s saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

The haugbui can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

Innate Spellcasting:
the haugbui\'s innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 18). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

constant: detect thoughts, invisibility, mage hand, scrying

at will: dancing lights, druidcraft, mending, spare the dying

7/day each: bane, create or destroy water, fog cloud, purify food and drink

5/day each: blindness/deafness, gust of wind, locate object, moonbeam, shatter

3/day each: bestow curse, dispel magic, plant growth, remove curse, telekinesis

1/day each: blight, contagion, dream

1/week each: geas, hallow

Legendary Resistance (3/Day):
If the haugbui fails a saving throw it can choose to succeed instead.

Sepulchral Scrying (1/Day):
An invisible magical eye is created under the haugbui\'s control, allowing it to watch its territory without leaving the burial mound. The eye travels at the speed of thought and can be up to 5 miles from the haugbui\'s location. The haugbui can see and hear as if it were standing at the eye\'s location, and it can use its innate spellcasting abilities as if it were at the eye\'s location. The eye can be noticed with a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check and can be dispelled as if it were 3rd-level spell. Spells that block other scrying spells work against Sepulchral Scrying as well. Unless dismissed by its creator or dispelled, lasts for up to 12 hours after its creation; only one can be created per 24-hour period.

Sunlight Sensitivity:
While in sunlight, the haugbui has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Turn Resistance:
The haugbui has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

Levitate:

Rejuvenation:
If it has a sacred vessel, a destroyed hierophant lich gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its hp and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the vessel.

The lich is an 9th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). The lich has the following cleric spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): guidance, mending, sacred flame, thaumaturgy

Those who fail a saving throw against the horned serpent’s Gem Gaze or bite attack become infected with the corpse cough disease.

The infected creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw each day or take 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. The target’s hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until the target is cured of the disease with a greater restoration spell or similar magic. If the infected creature comes into physical contact with a blood relative before the disease is cured, the relative must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. The blood relative is afflicted with a constant, wet cough within hours of infection, but the disease’s full effects don’t manifest until 1d4 days later. Corpse cough is so named due to the smell of the cough as the infected creature’s lungs become necrotic.

Poisonous Aura:
At the start of each of the horned serpent’s turns, each creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The target’s hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.

Hunter of the Lost:
The hound can transport itself to a different plane of existence. This works like the plane shift spell, except the hound can only affect itself, not other creatures, and can’t use it to banish an unwilling creature to another plane.

Swallow (3 actions, Roc Form Only):
Hraesvelgr makes a bite attack against a creature he has grappled. If he hits, he swallows the creature. A swallowed creature is no longer grappled, but is blinded, restrained, and has advantage against attacks and effects originating from outside Hraesvelgr. A swallowed creature takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of Hraesvelgr\'s turns. If Hraesvelgr returns to giant form, or takes 40 damage or more in a single turn from a swallowed creature, he must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which land prone within 10 feet of the giant.

hraesvelgr\'s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 19). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material or somatic components:

at will: feather fall, light

3/day: control weather

Keen Sight (Roc Form Only):
Hraesvelgr has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Legendary Resistance (3/day):
If Hraesvelgr fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

Shapechanger:
Hraesvelgr can use a bonus action to change into a roc. Any equipment he wears or carries melds into his new form. It keeps its game statistics except as noted. He reverts to his giant form if it is reduced to 0 hit points or when it uses a bonus action to change back.

Hraesvelgr\'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Hraesvelgr takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Hraesvelgr can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Hraesvelgr unleashes a blast of wind in a 60-foot cone. All creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

- One creature within 60 feet that Hraesvelgr can see must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be swept up in a pillar of wind. The creature is restrained and suspended 15 feet off the ground. If the creature has something to pull on, it can pull itself out of the wind by using an action and making a successful DC 15 Strength check; another creature who can reach the suspended creature can pull it free in the same way. Alternatively, a flying creature can repeat the saving throw as an action. On a success, it moves 5 feet out of the pillar of wind. This effect lasts until Hraesvelgr takes this action again or dies.

- Hraesvelgr lets out a thunderous bellow in giant form or an ear-splitting shriek in roc form. All creatures within 30 feet must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Regional Effects:
the region containing Hraesvelgr’s lair is warped by the corpse swallower’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Strong windstorms are common within 6 miles of the lair.

- Giant avian beasts are drawn to the lair and fiercely defend it against intruders.

- The wind within 10 miles of the lair bears a pungent carrion stench.

if Hraesvelgr dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.

Poor Senses:
A hulking whelp has poor hearing and is nearsighted. It can see in normal or dim light up to 30 feet and hear sounds from up to 60 feet away.

Unleashed Emotion:
When a hulking whelp feels threatened - it\'s touched, intimidated, cornered, attacked, or even just if a stranger moves adjacent to the whelp - it immediately grows from size Small to Huge as a reaction. If the whelp was attacked, this reaction occurs after the attack is made but before damage is done. Nearby creatures and objects are pushed to the nearest available space and must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone. Weapons, armor, and other objects worn or carried by the hulking whelp grow (and shrink again) proportionally when it changes size. Overcome by raw emotion, it sets about destroying anything and everything it can see (which isn\'t much) and reach (which is quite a lot). The transformation lasts until the hulking whelp is unaware of any nearby creatures for 1 round, it drops to 0 hit points, it has 5 levels of exhaustion, or it\'s affected by a calm emotions spell or comparable magic. The transformation isn\'t entirely uncontrollable; people or creatures the whelp knows and trusts can be near it without triggering the reaction. Under the wrong conditions, such as in a populated area, a hulking whelp\'s Unleashed Emotion can last for days.

76-100 Suggestible::

constant: confusion (always centered on the hundun), detect thoughts

at will: create or destroy water, dancing lights, mending, prestidigitation

ia\'Affrat can occupy another creature\'s space

and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening

large enough for a Tiny insect

Magic Resistance:
Ia\'Affrat has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects

Innate Spellcasting:
ia\'Affrat\'s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). Ia\'Affrat can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

at will: fire bolt, poison spray

3/day each: burning hands, invisibility, ray of enfeeblement, ray of sickness

1/day each: bestow curse, contagion, harm, insect plague, fireball

Inhabit:
Ia\'Affrat can enter the body of an incapacitated or dead creature by crawling into its mouth and other orifices. Inhabiting requires 1 minute, and the victim must be Small, Medium, or Large. If Ia\'Affrat inhabits a dead body, it can animate it and control its movements, effectively becoming a zombie for as long as it remains inside. Ia\'Affrat can abandon the body as an action. Attacks against the host deal half damage to Ia\'Affrat as well, but Ia\'Affrat\'s resistances and immunities still apply against this damage. In a living victim, Ia\'Affrat can control the victim\'s movement and actions as if using dominate monster (save DC 19) on the victim. Ia\'Affrat can consume a living victim; the target takes 5 (2d4) necrotic damage per hour while Ia\'Affrat inhabits its body, and Ia\'Affrat regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. When inhabiting a body, Ia\'Affrat can choose to have any spell it casts with a range of self, target the inhabited body rather than itself. The skin of a creature inhabited by Ia\'Affrat crawls with the forms of the insects inside. Ia\'Affrat can hide this telltale sign with a Charisma (Deception) check against a viewer\'s passive Insight. A greater restoration spell or comparable magic forces Ia\'Affrat to abandon the host.

Smoke Shroud:
Ia\'Affrat is shrouded in a 5-foot-radius cloud of dark smoke. This area is lightly obscured to creatures other than Ia\'Affrat. Any creature that needs to breathe that begins its turn in the area must make a successful DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its turn.

',
                    'attacks' => 'Bites:
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm\'s space.

The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Smoke Jump:
Ia\'Affrat can travel instantly to a space in sight where there\'s smoke.

Whirlwind (Recharge 4-6):
Each creature in Ia\'Affrat\'s space must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. Each creature that fails takes 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage and is flung up 20 feet away from Ia\'Affrat in a random direction and knocked prone. If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn\'t flung away or knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it traveled. If the target collides with another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

Tail:
Melee Weapon Attack:+10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage.

Wall of Ice:
The devil magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up to 30 feet long and 10 feet high, or it\'s a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet in diameter.
When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.

Icy Entangle:
Ice and snow hinder her opponent\'s movement, as the entangle spell (DC 17).

Kiss of the Frozen Heart:
An ice maiden may kiss a willing individual, freezing the target\'s heart. The target falls under the sway of a dominate spell, his or her alignment shifts to LE, and he or she gains immunity to cold. The ice maiden can have up to three such servants at once. The effect can be broken by dispel magic (DC 17), greater restoration, or the kiss of someone who loves the target.

Snowblind Burst:
In a snowy environment, the ice maiden attempts to blind all creatures within 30 feet of herself. Those who fail a DC 17 Charisma saving throw are blinded for 1 hour. Targets that are immune to cold damage are also immune to this effect.

Greatsword:
Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage plus 17 (5d6) necrotic damage. A creature hit by the sword must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks based on Strength or Dexterity until the end of its next turn.

Hellfire Bolt:
Ranged Spell Attack: +10 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) fire damage plus 17 (5d6) necrotic damage. A creature hit must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.

Reave Soul (Recharge 5-6):
The infernal knight targets a creature with 0 hp that it can see within 60 feet of it. If the creature is alive, it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or die and have its soul drawn into the infernal knight’s greatsword. If the creature is dead and has been dead for less than 1 minute, its soul is automatically captured. When the infernal knight captures a soul, it regains 30 hp, and Reave Soul recharges at the start of its next turn. While a creature’s soul is trapped, that creature can’t be returned to life by any means short of a wish spell.

A banishment spell targeted at the greatsword forces the infernal knight to make a Charisma saving throw against the spell. On a failed save, any souls trapped in the blade are released instead of the spell’s normal effect. Trapped souls are also released when the infernal knight dies.

Planar Rift (1/Day):
The infernal knight magically tears a rift in the fabric of the multiverse. The rift is a portal to a plane of the infernal knight’s choice. The portal remains open for 1 hour, during which time any creature can pass through it, moving from one plane to the other. A dispel magic spell targeting the rift can destroy it if the caster succeeds on a DC 18 spellcasting ability check.

Their sharp, shrill tongues and sharper claws make ink devils more distracting than their own combat prowess might indicate. As a bonus action, an ink devil can force a single foe within 30 feet of the ink devil to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or lose concentration until the beginning of the target\'s next turn.

Corrupt Scroll:
An ink devil can corrupt the magic within any scroll by touch. Any such corrupted scroll requires a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw to use successfully. If the check fails, the scroll\'s spell affects the caster if it is an offensive spell, or it affects the nearest devil if it is a beneficial spell.

Devil\'s Mark:
Ink devils can flick ink from their fingertips at a single target within 15 feet of the devil. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 13), or the affected creature gains a devil\'s mark.a black, red, or purple tattoo in the shape of an archduke\'s personal seal (most often Mammon or Totivillus but sometimes Arbeyach, Asmodeus, Beelzebub, Dispater, or others). All devils have advantage on spell attacks made against the devil-marked creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws made against spells and abilities used by devils. The mark can be removed only by a remove curse spell or comparable magic. In addition, the mark detects as faintly evil and often shifts its position on the body. Paladins, witchfinders, and some clerics may consider such a mark proof that a creature has made a pact with a devil.

Tail Slap:
Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (6d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage.

Breach:
The isonade leaps out of the water to crash down onto a target with devastating effect. The isonade must move 30 feet in a straight line toward its target before jumping. When jumping, the isonade travels up to 30 feet through the air before landing. Any creature occupying the space where the isonade lands takes 76 (12d10 + 10) bludgeoning damage and becomes submerged 10 feet below the surface of the water. Targets that make a successful DC 20 Strength saving throw take half damage and are not submerged, but are moved to the nearest unoccupied space. Boats and structures are not immune to this attack.

Swallow Whole:
When the isonade\'s bite attack hits a target grappled from a previous bite attack, the target is also swallowed. The grapple ends, but the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the isonade, and it takes 36 (8d8) acid damage at the start of each of the isonade\'s turns. An isonade can have two Large, four Medium, or six Small creatures swallowed at a time. If the isonade takes 40 damage or more from a swallowed creature in a single turn, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone within 10 feet of the isonade. If the isonade dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.

Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

Hidey-Hole:
When a kikimora chooses a house to inhabit, she scrawls a symbol on a wall, baseboard, cupboard, or semi.permanent object (like a stove) to be her tiny domain. This ability creates a hidden extra-dimensional dwelling. After creating a hidey-hole, a kikimora can teleport herself and up to 50 lb of objects to the designated location instead of making a normal move. This extradimensional space can only be entered by the kikimora or by a creature using a plane shift spell or ability. The location can be determined by casting detect magic in the area of the sigil, but it takes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to plane shift into the space. Inside the hidey-hole, a kikimora can see what is going on outside the space through a special sensor. This sensor functions like a window, and it can be blocked by mundane objects placed in front of the sigil. If she leaves an item in her space, it remains there even if she removes the sigil and places it in another location. If someone else removes the sigil, all contents are emptied into the Ethereal Plane (including any beings within her hidey-hole at the time). In this case, the kikimora can attempt a DC 15 Charisma saving throw to instead eject herself (but none of her possessions) into a space adjacent to the sigil.

While in sunlight, the kobold trapsmith has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Pack Tactics:
The kobold trapsmith has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the trapsmith\'s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn\'t incapacitated.

Thief\'s Tools:
The kobold trapsmith has proficiency with thief\'s tools and is seldom without them. If its tools are taken away or lost, it can cobble together a new set from wire, bits of metal, and other junk in 30 minutes.

Traps and Snares:
The kobold trapsmith excels at setting mechanical traps. Detecting, disarming, avoiding, or mitigating its traps require successful DC 13 checks or saving throws, and the traps have +5 attack bonuses. With thief\'s tools and basic construction materials, a trapsmith can set up one of the simple but effective traps listed below in 5 minutes. Triggers involve pressure plates, tripwires, small catches in a lock, or other simple mechanisms.

Choke Bomb:
This small incendiary device burns rapidly and releases choking smoke in a 20-foot sphere. The area is heavily obscured. Any breathing creature that\'s in the affected area when the cloud is created or that starts its turn in the cloud is poisoned. Once a poisoned creature leaves the cloud, it makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the poisoned condition on a success. The smoke dissipates after 10 minutes, or after 1 round in a strong wind.

Poisoned Sliver:
A poisoned sliver or needle can be hidden almost anywhere: inside a lock or a box, in a carpeted floor, on the underside of a door handle, in a cup of liquid or a bowl of gems. When someone meets the conditions for being jabbed by the sliver, the trap makes a melee weapon attack with advantage: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target; Hit: 2 (1d4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, or one-half poison damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

Skullpopper:
This trap consists of either a heavy weight, a spike, or a blade, set to fall or swing into a victim. When triggered, a skullpopper makes a melee weapon attack against the first target in its path: +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target; Hit: 11 (2d10) damage. The type of damage depends on how the skullpopper is built: a stone or heavy log does bludgeoning damage, a spiked log does piercing damage, a scything blade does slashing damage, etc.

Slingsnare:
A concealed loop of rope or wire is affixed to a counterweight. When a creature steps into the snare, it must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be yanked into the air and suspended, upside down, 5 feet above the ground. The snared creature is restrained (escape DC 13). The cord is AC 10 and has 5 hit points.

Light Crossbow:
Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage, or one-half poison damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

Shredder (Recharge 6):
The kobold trapsmith primes and throws a device at a point within 30 feet. The device explodes when it hits something solid, flinging razor-sharp spikes in a 15-foot-radius sphere. Every creature in the area takes 14 (4d6) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. The ground inside the spherical area is littered with spikes; it becomes difficult terrain, and a creature that falls prone in the area takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage.

Stunner (1/Day):
Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is restrained (escape DC 13). While restrained, the target takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage at the start of its turn and falls prone. The trapsmith has advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing metal armor. A stunner is a bola made of metal wire, magnets, and static electricity capacitors. A kobold trapsmith can recharge it during a long rest.

Enchanting Revels (1/Day at Dusk or Night Only):
The korrigan sings a magical melody and dances. Each humanoid within 60 feet of the korrigan that can hear the revels must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the revels end. For every korrigan that joins in the revels, the save DC increases by 1 (maximum DC 19).

Each korrigan participating in the revels must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing and must use its move action to move at least 5 feet to continue dancing. It can keep singing and dancing for up to 1 minute as long as it maintains concentration. The song ends if all of the korrigan lose concentration or stop singing and dancing.

A charmed target is incapacitated and begins to dance and caper for the duration of the revels. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A creature holding the egg containing Koschei\'s soul can use an action to compel Koschei as if a dominate monster spell were cast on him and Koschei failed his saving throw. As long as the soul is within the needle, Koschei can\'t permanently die. If he is killed, his body reforms in his lair in 1d10 days. If the needle is broken, Koschei can be killed like any other creature.

Innate Spellcasting:
koschei\'s innate spellcasting attribute is Charisma (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components.

at will: detect magic, phantom steed, scorching ray, sending

3/day each: invisibility, magic missile, shield

2/day each: animate objects, cone of cold, hypnotic pattern

1/day each: disintegrate, meteor swarm, true polymorph

Legendary Resistance (3/day):
If Koschei fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

Magic Weapons:
Koschei\'s weapon attacks are magical and do an extra 14 (4d6) necrotic damage (included below).

Koschei\'s Lair Actions:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Koschei takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Koschei can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Koschei creates a whirlwind centered on a point he can see within 100 feet. The whirlwind is 10 feet wide and up to 50 feet tall. A creature in the area of the whirlwind when it’s created, or who enters the area for the first time on a turn, must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained and takes 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage fromthe buffeting wind. A restrained creature can escape from the whirlwind by using its action to repeat the saving throw; on a success, it moves 5 feet outside the area of the whirlwind. The whirlwind lasts until Koschei uses this action again or dies.

- Tortured spirits appear and attack up to three creatures Koschei can see within the lair. One attack is made against each targeted creature; each attack has +8 to hit and does 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.

- Koschei disrupts the flow of magic in his lair. Until initiative count 20 on the following round, any creature other than a fiend who targets Koschei with a spell must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature still casts the spell, but it must target a creature other than Koschei.

Regional Effects:
the region containing Koschei’s lair is warped by Koschei’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Rabbits, ducks, and other game animals become hostile toward intruders within 5 miles of the lair. They behave aggressively, but only attack if cornered. Foraging for food by hunting is difficult and only yields half the normal amount of food.

- Wind and snowstorms are common within 5 miles of the lair.

- Koschei is aware of any spell cast within 5 miles of his lair. He knows the source of the magic (innate, the caster’s class, or a magic item) and knows the direction to the caster.

if Koschei dies, conditions in the area surrounding his lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.

The target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken from this attack, and Koschei regains an equal number of hit points. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

With a 10-foot running start, the lion can long jump up to 25 ft..

Darkness Vulnerability:
Magical darkness is harmful to a liosalfar: They take 2d10 necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw, each time they start their turn inside magical darkness. Natural darkness is unpleasant to them but not harmful.

Incorporeal Movement:
The liosalfar can move through other creatures and objects as difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

Innate Spellcasting:
the liosalfar\'s innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

at Will: augury, color spray, dancing lights, detect magic, flare, light, silent image, spare the dying

2/day each: alter self, blur, divination, hypnotic pattern, prismatic spray, scorching ray

1/day each: hallucinatory terrain, plane shift, sunbeam

Lightform:
Liosalfar are composed entirely of light. They are incorporeal and not subject to ability damage, polymorph, petrification, or attacks that alter their form.

Prismatic Glow:
Liosalfar shed rainbow illumination equal to a daylight spell. They cannot extinguish this glow without perishing but can reduce it to the level of torchlight at will. Even when using alter self they have a faint, diffused glow that\'s visible in dim light or darkness.

The Lord of the Hunt blows his hunting horn and chooses one creature he can see within 60 feet.

A charmed creature joins the wild hunt and follows the verbal instructions of the Lord of the Hunt, treating all former allies as enemies. If a charmed creature damages or is damaged by a former ally, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature successfully saves or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Call the Hunt for the next 24 hours.

While the Lord of the Hunt is mounted, any attack directed at his steed targets the rider instead. The steed uses the Lord of the Hunt\'s saving throws. If the mount succeeds on a saving throw against a damaging effect, it takes no damage.

Innate Spellcasting:
the lord of the hunt\'s innate spellcasting ability score is Charisma (save DC 16). The Lord of the Hunt can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components.

at will: druidcraft, hunter\'s mark, phantom steed

3/day each: commune with nature, conjure volley

1/day: conjure fey (conjured creatures vanish if the Lord of the Hunt\'s concentration is broken)

Legendary Resistance (3/day):
If the Lord of the Hunt fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

Magic Weapons:
The Lord of the Hunt\'s weapon attacks are magical.

Lord of the Hunt\'s Lair:
non initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Lord of the Hunt takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Lord of the Hunt can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The Lord of the Hunt chooses a point he can see within the lair. Plants erupt from the ground in a 20-foot radius surrounding that point, creating difficult terrain. Any creatures in the area at the start of their turn, or who enter the area for the first time on a turn, must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained by the vines and take 13 (3d8) poison damage. A creature can be freed if it or an adjacent ally uses an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check. This effect lasts until the Lord of the Hunt uses this lair action again, or dies.

- The Lord of the Hunt lets out a war cry. A creature the Lord can see within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.

- The Lord of the Hunt magically marks a target he can see within 120 feet. The Lord has advantage on attack rolls against the marked target. The mark lasts until initiative count 20 on the following turn.

Regional Effects:
the region containing Lord of the Hunt’s encampment is warped by his magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Game animals become plentiful within 3 miles of the lair. Wisdom (Survival) checks to hunt for food are made with advantage, but patrols from the Wild Hunt don’t take kindly to poachers.

- Domesticated animals within 3 miles of the lair become skittish and fearful. They are more difficult to handle and flee the area if left to their own devices.

- Areas of natural terrain within 3 miles of the lair subtly rearrange themselves to create game trails through even the densest wilderness.

when the Lord of the Hunt breaks camp or dies, the area around the previous campsite returns to normal immediately.

Lightwalking:
Once per round, the lunar devil magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, from one beam of moonlight to another within 80 feet. This relocation uses half of its speed.

Magic Resistance:

at will: charm person, detect magic, dispel magic, fabricate (Mammon can create valuable objects), heat metal, magic aura

3/day each: animate objects, counterspell, creation, instant summons, legend lore, teleport

1/day each: imprisonment (minimus containment only, inside gems), sunburst

Legendary Resistance (3/day):
If Mammon fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

Magic Resistance:
Mammon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Magic Weapons:
Mammon\'s weapon attacks are magical.

Mammon\'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Mammon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Mammon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Mammon infuses a pile of treasure in his lair with life. It becomes an earth elemental made of precious metals and gems. The elemental acts immediately and lasts until destroyed or until Mammon uses this action again.

- Stacked piles of treasure shift and slide, collapsing onto a creature Mammon can see. The creature is restrained until initiative count 20 on the following round, or until it or an adjacent ally uses an action to make a successful DC 18 Strength check to free it.

- Mammon magically teleports from one area of treasure to another within 150 feet.

Regional Effects:
the region containing Mammon’s lair is warped by the archdevil’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Treasure in the possession of creatures other than Mammon turns to worthless materials such as lead, wood, or gravel, after spending 24 hours within 1 mile of the lair. The resulting junk resumes its valuable form when Mammon claims it, or by means of a wish spell or comparable magic.

- Creatures that spend more than 1 hour within 1 mile of Mammon’s lair become obsessed with gaining the most generous payment or portion of wealth in any dealing unless they succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. A creature that saves successfully is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The effect can be removed by a greater restoration spell or comparable magic.

- Any naturally occurring treasure in Mammon’s home plane reverts to worthless junk if removed from the plane. Similarly, any mundane item left behind transforms into something fantastically valuable, as long as it remains on the plane.

if Mammon dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.

Mammon can use this ability as a bonus action immediately after hitting a creature with his purse attack. The creature must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified by being turned to solid gold. Otherwise, a creature that fails the saving throw is restrained. A restrained creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature receives a greater restoration spell or comparable magic.

Consume the Spark:
The mandriano drains the essence of one grappled target. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 13 (4d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target’s hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the mandriano regains hp equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way rises 24 hours later as a zombie or skeleton under the mandriano’s control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The mandriano can control up to twelve undead at one time.

Hit: 19 (2d12 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (2d10) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion. The target recovers from all exhaustion caused by the enervating spiked gauntlet at the end of its next long rest.

Wail of the Forgotten (Recharge 6):
The mask wight emits an ear-piercing wail. All creatures within 30 feet of the wight take 65 (10d12) thunder damage and are permanently deafened; a successful DC 17 Charisma saving throw reduces damage to half and limits the deafness to 1d4 hours. Targets slain by this attack are erased from the memories of every creature in the planes, all written or pictorial references to the target fade away, and its body is obliterated.the only exception is those who personally witnessed the death. Restoring such a slain creature requires a wish or divine intervention; no mortal remembers the creature\'s life or death.

Magic Weapons:
Mechuiti\'s weapon attacks are magical.

Diseased Ichor:
Every time Mechuiti takes piercing or slashing damage, a spray of caustic blood spurts from the wound toward the attacker. This spray forms a line 10 feet long and 5 feet wide. The first creature in the line must make a successful DC 24 Constitution saving throw against disease or be infected by Mechuiti\'s Ichor disease. The creature is poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must make a successful DC 24 Constitution saving throw or reduce its hit point maximum by 5 (2d4). The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target\'s hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

Innate Spellcasting:
mechuiti\'s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks). Mechuiti can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

at will: dispel magic, fireball, hold monster, wall of fire

3/day each: fire storm, power word stun

1/day each: meteor swarm, power word kill

Speak with Apes:
Mechuiti can communicate simple concepts to apes.

Mechuiti\'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Mechuiti takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. Mechuiti can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- Mechuiti targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of it, and a fissure full of lava opens under the target’s feet. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 28 (8d6) fire damage.

- The whole volcano trembles and shakes. Each creature on a solid surface other than a demon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. All ground in the volcano becomes difficult terrain for creatures other than a demon until initiative count 20 on the next round.

- Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point Mechuiti can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.

- The pain of all creatures other than demons within 120 feet of Mechuiti is intensified. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, every time a creature affected this way takes damage, he must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

Regional Effects:
the region containing Mechuiti’s lair is warped by its presence, which creates one or more of the following effects.

- Mechuiti can make the volcano erupt at will. A cloud of hot ashes and smoke covers a 6 mile area around the volcano, and magma flows from the volcano’s cone.

- When intelligent creatures within 6 miles sleep, they dream with Mechuiti. Unless they make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, they are compelled to seek out and join Mechuiti’s cult.

- Water within 1 mile of the lair carries Mechuiti’s Ichor disease. Any creature that drinks the water must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or be infected. An infected creature is poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (2d4). The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target’s hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

when Mechuiti dies, all these regional effects fade immediately.

Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) slashing damage. If Mechuiti scores a critical hit, it rolls damage dice three times instead of twice.

Immolating Breath (Recharge 5-6):
Mechuiti exhales fire and acid in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that cone takes 21 (6d6) fire damage plus 21 (6d6) acid damage, or half damage with a successful DC 24 Dexterity saving throw.

Immolating Corona:
Mechuiti\'s fiery crown explodes into a burst of yellow-green flames. All creatures within 30 feet of Mechuiti take 10 (3d6) fire damage plus 10 (3d6) acid damage, or half damage with a successful DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature also catches fire and takes 3 (1d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns while on fire. A creature can use an action to extinguish a fire on itself or on another creature within 5 feet.

Frightful Presence:
Each creature of Mechuiti\'s choice that is within 120 feet of Mechuiti and aware of it must succeed on a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature\'s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Mechuiti\'s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

Acid Spray (Recharge 6):
The megapede spits acid in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide, provided that it has no creature grappled. Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The thrall exhales a blast of acidic spores from its rotten lungs in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area takes 36 (8d8) acid damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature is also infected with mindrot spores.

Mindrot Spores:
Infection occurs when mindrot spores are inhaled or swallowed. Infected creatures must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of every long rest; nothing happens if the saving throw succeeds, but if it fails, the creature takes 9 (2d8) acid damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by the same amount. The infection ends when the character makes successful saving throws after two consecutive long rests, or receives the benefits of a lesser restoration spell or comparable magic.

Innate Spellcasting:
the mirager\'s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

3/day: charm person

1/day each: hallucinatory terrain, suggestion

Enthralling Mirage:
When the mirager casts hallucinatory terrain, the area appears so lush and inviting that those who view it feel compelled to visit. Any creature that approaches within 120 feet of the terrain must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail are affected as by the enthrall spell with the mirager as the caster; they give the mirage their undivided attention, wanting only to explore it, marvel at its beauty, and rest there for an hour. The mirager can choose to have creatures focus their attention on it instead of the hallucinatory terrain. Creatures affected by the enthrall effect automatically fail saving throws to disbelieve the hallucinatory terrain. This effect ends if the hallucinatory terrain is dispelled.

Slam:
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.

Thirst Kiss:
The mirager feeds on the body moisture of creatures it lures into kissing it. A creature must be charmed, grappled, or incapacitated to be kissed. A kiss hits automatically, does 21 (6d6) necrotic damage, and fills the mirager with an exultant rush of euphoria that has the same effect as a heroism spell lasting 1 minute. The creature that was kissed doesn\'t notice that it took damage from the kiss unless it makes a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check.

Captivating Dance (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest, Humanoid Form Only):
The mirager performs a sinuously swaying dance. Humanoids within 20 feet that view this dance must make a successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for 1d4 rounds and charmed by the mirager for 1 minute. Humanoids of all races and genders have disadvantage on this saving throw. A creature that saves successfully is immune to this mirager\'s dance for the next 24 hours.

Lightwalking:
The Moonlit King teleports from one area of moonlight to another within 100 feet.

Aura of Madness (2 actions):
While he is standing in an area of moonlight, the Moonlit King can spread his madness to other creatures within 30 feet. A creature other than a fiend that starts its turn in the aura or enters it for the first time on a turn (including when the aura is created) must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or be confused (as if affected by the confusion spell) until the start of its next turn.

                    'special_abilities' => 'Control Moonlight:
As a bonus action, the Moonlit King can cause all areas of moonlight within 100 feet to move up to 10 feet.

Innate Spellcasting:
the Moonlit King\'s innate spellcasting ability score is Charisma (save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). The Moonlit King can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components.

at will: continual flame, detect evil and good, invisibility (self only), moonbeam, zone of truth

3/day each: blight, dispel evil and good, dispel magic

1/day each: demiplane, heal

Legendary Resistance (3/day):
If the Moonlit King fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

Magic Weapons:
The Moonlit King\'s weapon attacks are magical, and deal an extra 7 (2d6) radiant damage (included below).

Moonlit King\'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Moonlit King takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Moonlit King can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The Moonlit King creates four beams of moonlight at four points he can see within 100 feet. The beams each illuminate a 10-foot radius with dim light. These moon beams last until the Moonlit King uses this action again, or until he dies.

- The Moonlit King chooses a point he can see within 100 feet. Disembodied whispers speaking of despair and failure fill a 30-foot radius from that point. All creatures other than fiends in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until initiative count 20 on the following round.

- The Moonlit King magically summons four shadow demons. The demons appear in unoccupied spaces the Moonlit King can see within 60 feet. The demons act immediately and remain until initiative count 20 on the following round.

Regional Effects:
the region containing the Moonlit King’s lair is warped by the fey lord’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Dreams and fears take on a life of their own. Minor visual and auditory hallucinations plague creatures within 6 miles of the lair.

- The Moonlit King can communicate telepathically with and share the senses of any stryx within 10 miles of his lair.

- Weather conditions don’t inhibit moonlight shining within 10 miles of the lair; clouds part, rain seems to channel moonbeams, snow takes on a luminous silver glow.

if the Moonlit King dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.

                    'attacks' => 'Multiattack:
The Moonlit King makes three attacks with either his crystal staff or his moon bolt.

Crystal Staff:
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) radiant damage. A target that is struck by the staff two or more times in one turn must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

Moon Bolt:
Ranged Spell Attack: +11 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d10) radiant damage. If the target is a creature in a form other than its natural form, it takes an additional 22 (4d10) radiant damage and must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or revert to its natural form. When the moon bolt hits a target, moonlight glows in a 10-foot radius from that point, creating dim light. The light is stationary and lasts until the end of the Moonlit King\'s next turn.

Fearful Shadows (Recharge 5-6):
The Moonlit King magically animates the shadows of all foes within 60 feet of himself. The animated shadows attack the creatures who cast them. All affected creatures in the area take 35 (10d6) necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw also loses 1d4 points from its Strength score. A creature reduced to 0 Strength is unconscious until it regains at least 1 point of Strength. Strength lost to fearful shadows returns when the creature finishes a short or long rest.

Summon Devil (1/Day):
The Moonlit King magically summons a lunar devil. The summoned devil appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can\'t summon other devils. It remains for 10 minutes, until its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

The mordant snare has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Absorb Channeled Energy:
If a mordant snare is in the area of effect of a turn undead attempt, it gains temporary hit points. For each mordant puppet that would have been affected by the turning if it were a zombie, the mordant snare gains 10 temporary hit points, to a maximum of 60.

Buried:
Until it does something to reveal its presence, a buried mordant snare is treated as if it\'s invisible.

Mordant Puppets:
A mordant snare can control up to four bodies per tentacle. These "puppets"look and move like zombies. Treat each one as a zombie, but limited in movement to the 30-foot-by-30-foot area above the buried snare. Unlike normal zombies, any creature within 5 feet of a mordant puppet when the puppet takes piercing or slashing damage takes 3 (1d6) acid damage (spray from the wound). All puppets attached to a particular tentacle are destroyed if the mordant snare attacks with that tentacle; this does 9 (2d8) acid damage per puppet to all creatures within 5 feet of any of those puppets, or half damage with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Damage done to puppet zombies doesn\'t affect the mordant snare. If the snare is killed, all of its puppets die immediately without causing any acid damage.

If the myling still has the victim grappled at the start of the myling\'s next turn, both of them disappear into the earth. While buried this way, a creature is considered stunned. It can free itself with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, but only one check is allowed; if it fails, the creature is powerless to aid itself except with magic. The creature must also make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw; if it succeeds, the creature has a lungful of air and can hold its breath for (Constitution modifier + 1) minutes before suffocation begins. Otherwise, it begins suffocating immediately. Allies equipped with digging tools can reach it in four minutes divided by the number of diggers; someone using an improvised tool (a sword, a plate, bare hands) counts as only one-half of a digger.

Shapechanger:
The naina can use her action to polymorph into one of her two forms: a drake or a female humanoid. She cannot alter either form\'s appearance or capabilities (with the exception of her breath weapon) using this ability, and damage sustained in one form transfers to the other form.

A creature caught in this sleeping gas must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 6 rounds. A sleeping creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns; it wakes up if it makes the save successfully.

While attached to a living host, a necrotic tick leaks negative energy into the host’s bloodstream, quickly closing over the creature’s wounds with scabrous, necrotic flesh.

Magical healing reverses the necrosis and subtracts an equal number of necrotic hp from those accumulated. When the necrotic hp equal the host’s hit point maximum, the host becomes a zombie.

Ride Host:
When a necrotic tick’s living host has lost three-quarters of its maximum hp from Blood Drain, the tick’s toxins fill the host with an unnatural desire to approach other living beings. When a suitable creature is within 5 feet, the tick incites a sudden rage in the host, riding the current host to a new host. The current host must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or it attempts to grapple a living creature within 5 feet of it as a reaction. The host can re-attempt this saving throw at the end of each turn that it suffers damage from the necrotic tick’s Blood Drain.

If it fails, it is affected by the tick’s toxins and doesn’t attempt to remove the tick. The host will even replace a dislodged tick unless prevented from doing so for 1 minute, after which the tick’s influence fades.

The tick can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so when seeking a new host or if the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the tick. When a necrotic tick detaches, voluntarily or otherwise, its host takes 1 necrotic damage.

A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the neophron, and it takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the neophron’s turns.

The neophron can only swallow one creature at a time. If a humanoid dies while swallowed, it transforms into a ghast. At the start of its next turn, the neophron regurgitates the ghast into an unoccupied space within 10 feet. The ghast is under the neophron’s control and acts immediately after the neophron in the initiative count.

If the neophron takes 20 or more damage in a single turn from a creature inside it, the neophron must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the neophron. If the neophron dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape the corpse by using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.

Claw:
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.

The nian creates magical darkness and silence around it in a 15-foot-radius sphere that moves with it and spreads around corners. The dark silence lasts as long as the nian maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). The nian sees objects in the sphere in shades of gray. Darkvision can’t penetrate the darkness, no natural light can illuminate it, no sound can be created within or pass through it, and any creature or object entirely inside the sphere of dark silence is immune to thunder damage. Creatures entirely inside the darkness are deafened and can’t cast spells that include a verbal component. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is destroyed.

This ability is negated for grapple attempts if the attacker is wearing gold or orichalcum gauntlets or using a gold or orichalcum chain as part of its attack.

Imbue Luck (1/Day):
Nichny can enchant a small gem or stone to bring good luck. If the nichny gives this lucky stone to another creature, the bearer receives a +1 bonus to all saving throws for 24 hours.

Innate Spellcasting:
the nichny\'s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

at Will: detect magic, invisibility, magic missile, ray of frost

3/day each: blink, dimension door, haste, polymorph (self only)

1/day each: teleport, word of recall

Luck Aura:
A nichny is surrounded by an aura of luck. All creatures it considers friends within 10 feet of the nichny gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Creatures that it considers its enemies take a -1 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. The nichny can activate or suppress this aura on its turn as a bonus action.

Magic Resistance:
The nichny has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Soothsaying:
Once per week, a nichny can answer up to three questions about the past, present, or future. All three questions must be asked before the nichny can give its answers, which are short and may be in the form of a paradox or riddle. One answer always is false, and the other two must be true.

At will: detect magic, magic missile
2/day each: plane shift (self only), ray of enfeeblement, sleep

Magic Resistance:
The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Night Hag Items:
A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for herself If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.
Heartstone: This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.
Soul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag\'s Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).

Hag Coven:
When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.
A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.

Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only):
While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard\'s spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:

• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness
• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object
• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt
• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph
• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying
• 6th level (1 slot): eye bite

For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag\'s Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag\'s Intelligence modifier.

Hag Eye (Coven Only):
A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.
A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can\'t perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

Change Shape:
The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn\'t transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.

Etherealness:
The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession.

Nightmare Haunting (1/Day):
While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target\'s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag\'s soul bag. The reduction to the target\'s hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.

A nightgarm can have up to 14 falsemen under her control at a time. A nightgarm can communicate telepathically with its falsemen at ranges up to 200 feet.

Quadruped:
The nightgarm can drop any objects it is holding to run on all fours. When it does so, its speed increases to 40ft.

Distending Maw:
Like snakes, nightgarms can open their mouths far wider than other creatures of similar size. This ability grants it a formidable bite and allows it to swallow creatures up to Medium size.

Superstitious:
A nightgarm must stay at least 5 feet away from a brandished holy symbol or a burning sprig of wolf\'s bane, and it cannot touch or make melee attacks against a creature holding one of these items. After 1 round, the nightgarm can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw at the start of each of its turns; if the save succeeds, the nightgarm temporarily overcomes its superstition and these restrictions are lifted until the start of the nightgarm\'s next turn.

Innate Spellcasting:
the nightgarm\'s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

It takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the nightgarm\'s turns. A nightgarm can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If the nightgarm takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the nightgarm must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone within 5 feet of the nightgarm.

After 1 minute, the diseased creature\'s skin becomes translucent and slimy. The creature cannot regain hit points unless it is at least partially underwater, and the disease can only be removed by heal or comparable magic. Unless the creature is either fully submerged or frequently doused with water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes.

Form Swap:
As a bonus action, the nihilethic zombie can alter between its material and ethereal forms at will.

Sacrifice Life:
A nihilethic zombie can sacrifice itself to heal a nihileth within 30 feet of it. All of its remaining hit points transfer to the nihileth in the form of healing. The nihilethic zombie is reduced to 0 hit points and it doesn\'t make an Undead Fortitude saving throw. A nihileth cannot be healed above its maximum hit points in this manner.

Also, any cure spell cast on the blinded creature ends the temporary blindness, but not restoration spells. If a creature that\'s already temporarily blinded is targeted again by eye extraction and fails the saving throw, that creature becomes permanently blind as its eyes are pulled from their sockets to join the swarm (causing 1d8 piercing damage). Success on either saving throw renders that creature immune to eye extraction for 24 hours (but it still doesn\'t recover its sight until it gets out of the swarm). An oculo swarm with 50 or fewer hit points can\'t use this ability.

Gaze (recharge 5-6):
The swarm targets every creature in its space with a gaze attack. The swarm can choose one of two effects for the attack: confusion or hold person. Every target in the swarm\'s space is affected unless it makes a successful DC 14 Charisma saving throw. Even creatures that avert their eyes or are blind can be affected by an oculus swarm\'s gaze.

If only two circlet wearers are within 1 mile of the active dragon, each hour spent wearing the circlets imposes one level of exhaustion on those wearers. If only a single wearer is within 1 mile of the active dragon, each minute spent wearing the circlet gives that wearer one level of exhaustion. If no circlet wearers are within 1 mile of the dragon, it views all creatures it can see as enemies and tries to destroy them until a circlet wearer communicates with the dragon or the dragon is destroyed. A circlet wearer can use its action to put the dragon in an inactive state where it becomes incapacitated until a wearer uses an action to switch the dragon to active.

Mirage:
As a bonus action, the oozasis can create a mirage around itself to lure victims toward it while disguising its true nature. This functions as the mirage arcane spell (save DC 16) but is nonmagical, and therefore can\'t be detected using detect magic or similar magic, and can\'t be dispelled.

Waters of Unfathomable Compulsion:
Any creature that drinks the water of an oozasis or eats fruit from the plants growing in it has a dream (as the spell, save DC 16) the next time it sleeps. In this dream, the oozasis places a compulsion to carry out some activity as a torrent of images and sensations. When the creature awakens, it is affected by a geas spell (save DC 16, cast as a 7th-level spell) in addition to the effects of dream.

Pseudopod:
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) acid damage, and a target that\'s Large or smaller is grappled (escape DC 16) and restrained until the grapple ends. The oozasis has two pseudopods, each of which can grapple one target at a time.

Engulf:
The oozasis engulfs creatures grappled by it. An engulfed creature can\'t breathe, is restrained, is no longer grappled, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the oozasis, takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the oozasis\'s turns, and is subject to the oozasis\'s Waters of Unfathomable Compulsion trait. The creature takes no damage if the oozasis chooses not to inflict any. When the oozasis moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can escape by using an action and making a successful DC 16 Strength check. On a success, the creature enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the oozasis.

Vapors of Tranquility or Turmoil (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):
The oozasis sublimates its waters into a vapor that fills a disk centered on the oozasis, 60 feet in radius, and 10 feet thick. All creatures in the area are affected by either the calm emotions spell or the confusion spell (save DC 16). The oozasis chooses which effect to use, and it must be the same for all creatures.

Sage Advice:
An orobas sometimes twists responses to a divination. It softens the answer, leaves crucial information out of the response, manipulates a convoluted answer, or outright lies. An orobas always has advantage on Deception and Persuasion checks when revealing the result of a divination.

The ostinato makes two cacophony ray attacks.

Cacophony Ray:
Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) thunder damage.

Aural Symbiosis (1/Day):
One humanoid that the ostinato can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or the ostinato merges with it, becoming an enjoyable, repetitive tune in its host\'s mind. The ostinato can\'t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect. The target retains control of its body and is aware of the ostinato\'s presence only as a melody, not as a living entity. The target no longer needs to eat or drink, gains the ostinato\'s Magic Resistance trait, and has advantage on Charisma checks. It also has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and it can\'t maintain concentration on spells or other effects for more than a single turn. The target can make a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check once every 24 hours; on a success, it realizes that the music it hears comes from an external entity. The Aural Symbiosis lasts until the target drops to 0 hit points, the ostinato ends it as a bonus action, or the ostinato is forced out by a dispel evil and good spell or comparable magic. When the Aural Symbiosis ends, the ostinato bursts forth in a thunderous explosion of sound and reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target. All creatures within 60 feet, including the original target, take 21 (6d6) thunder damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw. The target becomes immune to this ostinato\'s Aural Symbiosis for 24 hours if it succeeds on the saving throw or after the Aural Symbiosis ends.

Voracious Aura (1/Day):
While merged with a humanoid (see Aural Symbiosis), the ostinato feeds on nearby creatures. Up to nine creatures of the ostinato\'s choice within 60 feet of it can be targeted. Each target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or take 3 (1d6) necrotic damage and have its hit point maximum reduced by the same amount until it finishes a long rest. The target dies if its maximum hit points are reduced to 0. Victims notice this damage immediately, but not its source.

Hovering Darkness:
An owl harpy that hovers in flight can shake a fine, magical dander from her wings over a creature within 20 feet and directly below her. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious and be poisoned for 10 minutes. It wakes up if it takes damage or if a creature uses an action to shake it awake, but waking up doesn\'t end the poisoning.

Luring Song:
The owl harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must use a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy becomes incapacitated. While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. A charmed target that is more than 5 feet away from the harpy must move at its highest rate (including dashing, if necessary) along the most direct route to get within 5 feet of the harpy. The charmed creature doesn\'t maneuver to avoid opportunity attacks, but it can repeat the saving throw every time it takes damage from anything other than the harpy. It also repeats the saving throw before entering damaging terrain (lava or a pit, for example), if the most direct route includes a dangerous space. A creature also repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. A successful saving throw ends the effect on that creature and makes the creature immune to this harpy\'s song for 24 hours.

A charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

Punish Transgressor:
The drake targets a single creature within 60 feet that broke the terms of a pact witnessed by the drake. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1d6 minutes. The conditions can be ended early only with a dispel magic (DC 15) spell or similar magic. When these conditions end, the affected creature has disadvantage on saving throws until it finishes a long rest.

Enhanced Eldritch Blast:
Ranged Spell Attack: +10 to hit, range 300 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) force damage. On a successful hit, the pact lich can push the target 10 feet away from it in a straight line.

The pact lich targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target disappears and is paralyzed as it is hurtled through the nightmare landscape of the lower planes. At the end of the pact lich’s next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space, and is no longer paralyzed. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 55 (10d10) psychic damage when it returns.

The philosopher’s ghost can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

The piasa exhales sleep gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

Demonic Possession (Recharge 6):
One humanoid that the pishacha can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be possessed by the pishacha; the pishacha then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses some control of its body, succumbing to a random short-term madness (see the System Reference Document 5.1) each round for 3d6 rounds. At the end of the 3d6 rounds, the pishacha becomes dormant within the body.

While possessing a victim, the pishacha attempts to seize control of the body again every 1d4 hours. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or succumb to another 3d6 round period of random short-term madness. Even if the target succeeds, it is still possessed. If the target is still possessed at the end of a long rest, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or gain a long-term madness.

While possessing a victim, the pishacha can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except those that can turn or repel fiends, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hp, the pishacha ends it as a bonus action, or the pishacha is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. The pishacha can also be forced out if the victim eats a bowl of rice that has been cooked in holy water. When the possession ends, the pishacha reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body.

The target is immune to possession by the same pishacha for 24 hours after succeeding on the initial saving throw or after the possession ends.

Invisibility:
The pishacha magically turns invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).

The pombero can twist and squeeze itself through a space small enough for a Tiny bird to pass through as if it were difficult terrain.

Sneak Attack (1/turn):
The pombero does an extra 7 (2d6) damage with a weapon attack when it has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the pombero that isn\'t incapacitated and the pombero doesn\'t have disadvantage on the roll.

Charming Touch (recharge 5-6):
The pombero chooses a creature it can see within 5 feet. The creature must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 10 minutes. The effect ends if the charmed creature takes damage. The pombero can have only one creature at a time charmed with this ability. If it charms a new creature, the previous charm effect ends immediately.

Invisibility:
The pombero becomes invisible until it chooses to end the effect as a bonus action, or when it attacks.

Magic Weapons:

Steal Weapons:
The eldritch magic that powers the pillar produces a magnetic power that seizes metal objects that touch it, including metal weapons. When a creature successfully strikes the pillar with a metal melee weapon, the attacker must make a successful DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw or the weapon becomes stuck to the pillar until the pillar releases it or is destroyed. The saving throw uses the same ability as the attack used. The pillar can release all metal weapons stuck to it whenever it wants. A pillar always drops all weapons stuck to it when it believes it\'s no longer threatened. This ability affects armor only during a grapple.

The psoglav emits a beam from its single eye. One target within 60 feet of the psoglav is hit automatically by the ray. The target is knocked 20 feet back and must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. The target\'s shadow stays in the space the target was originally in, and acts as an undead shadow under the command of the psoglav demon. If the creature hit with the shadow stealing ray flees the encounter, it is without a natural shadow for 1d12 days before the undead shadow fades and the creature\'s natural shadow returns. The undead shadow steals the body of its creature of origin if that creature is killed during the encounter; in that case, the creature\'s alignment shifts to evil and it falls under the command of the psoglav. The original creature regains its natural shadow immediately if the undead shadow is slain. A creature can only have its shadow stolen by the shadow stealing ray once per day, even if hit by the rays of two different psoglav demons, but it can be knocked back by it every time it is hit.

1/day each: earthquake, teleport

Magic Weapons:

Qorgeth\'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Qorgeth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Qorgeth can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Until initiative count 20 on the following round, Qorgeth twists space through the tunnels of its lair. Any creature other than a demon that tries to move must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or move half its speed in a random direction before getting its bearings; it can then finish moving as it wants.

- A section of ceiling in the lair collapses, raining debris onto a 20-foot-radius area. Each creature in the area must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage and be restrained until the end of its next turn.

- Thick tangles of demonic worms erupt in the space of up to three creatures Qorgeth can see within 60 feet. Each targeted creature is attacked once by the worms (Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target; Hit: 14 (4d6) piercing).

Regional Effects:
the region containing Qorgeth’s lair is warped by the demon lord’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Tunnels within 5 miles of the lair attract all manner of worms and vermin, including purple worms. These creatures are ravenous and violent.

- Within 1 mile of the lair, food rots and spontaneously erupts with maggots. One day worth of food carried by creatures spoils every 24 hours it remains in the area. It is impossible to forage for food in this area.

- Dead bodies within 1 mile of the lair decay quickly. Any corpse is reduced to bones in 24 hours. Magic that prevents decay staves off this decomposition normally. Anointing the body with holy water prevents decomposition for one day but no longer.

if Qorgeth dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.

',
                    'attacks' => 'Multiattack:
Qorgeth makes one bite attack, two crush attacks, and one stinger attack.

Bite:
Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (2d12 + 9) piercing damage. A target creature of Large size or smaller must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by Qorgeth. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, and takes 16 (3d10) necrotic damage at the start of each of Qorgeth\'s turns. Qorgeth can have any number of creatures swallowed at one time. If Qorgeth takes 50 damage or more in a single turn from a creature it has swallowed, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, who land prone within 10 feet of Qorgeth. If Qorgeth dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained, and can escape the corpse by spending 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.

Crush:
Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) bludgeoning damage. A target creature is also grappled and restrained (escape DC 19) until Qorgeth moves. Qorgeth can grapple up to two creatures at once; at least one of Qorgeth\'s crush attacks must be directed against each creature it has grappled.

Stinger:
Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d6 + 9) piercing damage, and the target takes 33 (6d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 hour; a successful DC 23 Constitution saving throw reduces poison damage by half and negates the poisoned condition. A creature that fails the save by 10 or more is also paralyzed for as long as the poisoned condition lasts.

Shadowborn:
When in lighting other than bright light, the Queen of Night and Magic has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, and she can hide even while being observed.

Spellcasting:
the Queen of Night and Magic is an 18th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). The Queen knows the following sorcerer spells:

cantrips (at will): blade ward, chill touch, dancing lights, mage hand, prestidigitation, ray of frost

1st level (4 slots): mage armor, magic missile, shield

2nd level (3 slots): darkness, mirror image

3rd level (3 slots): blink, fear

4th level (3 slots): confusion, greater invisibility

5th level (3 slots): cone of cold, teleportation circle

6th level (1 slot): circle of death

7th level (1 slot): plane shift, prismatic spray

8th level (1 slot): dominate monster

9th level (1 slot): meteor swarm

The Queen of Night and Magic\'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Queen of Night and Magic takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Queen of Night and Magic can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The Queen wills darkness to overpower the light. All bright light sources in the lair shed only dim light to their normal bright light radius, and dim light sources are extinguished. This lasts until the Queen dismisses the effect or dies.

- An opaque wall of writhing shadows springs up from a solid surface within 120 feet of the Queen. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. Each creature in the area must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. Creatures in the wall’s space are pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall they choose. A creature can move through the wall, but the semimaterial shadow resists intrusion. For every foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, any creature that, during its own turn, occupies any part of the wall’s space takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to radiant damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. The wall lasts until the Queen uses this lair action again, or until she dies.

- The Queen targets one creature within 60 feet of her and assails its mind with visions of hopelessness and despair. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until initiative count 20 on the next round.

Regional Effects:
the region containing the Queen of Night and Magic’s lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Shadows come to life within 6 miles of the Queen’s lair. Most of the time these living shadows are unnerving and nothing more, but when a creature acts against the interests of the Queen, the shadows can interfere and cause any relevant die roll to be made with disadvantage.

- Magic saturates the area within 6 miles of the lair, causing minor random effects similar to a prestidigitation cantrip.

- The Queen of Night and Magic can cast her senses to any area containing darkness, dim light, or shadows within 6 miles of her lair, similar to a clairvoyance spell.

while the Summer Court rules, the regional effects of the Queen’s lair extend into the Winter Palace, but they are diminished and weaker than normal. During the Winter Court’s reign, the Winter Palace is not subject to the regional effects. If the Queen of Night and Magic dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair gradually return to normal over the course of 2d10 days.

',
                    'attacks' => 'Multiattack:

Rapier:
Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage.

Shadow Rift (Recharge 5-6):
The Queen of Night and Magic creates a shadowy rift in a 20-foot sphere centered on a point she can see within 150 feet. Any creature within the rift takes 72 (16d8) cold damage, or half damage with a successful DC 23 Constitution saving throw. Creatures that fail the saving throw are also restrained by icy wisps of shadow. A restrained creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the restrained condition on a success.

Star Strike:
Ranged Spell Attack: +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d8) fire damage plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage.

Teleport:
The Queen of Night and Magic teleports to an unoccupied space up to 60 feet away.

Unravel:
The Queen of Night and Magic targets a creature, object, or magical effect that she can see. For every spell affecting the target, the Queen makes a Charisma check; the DC equals 10 + the spell\'s level. On a success, the spell is dispelled.

nicnevin\'s spellcasting attribute is Charisma (save DC 19, +12 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

at will: faerie fire, hex, misty step, silent image, tongues

3/day each: chain lightning, counterspell, dispel magic, hypnotic pattern, teleportation circle

2/day each: bestow curse, feeblemind, mass suggestion, flesh to stone

1/day each: power word kill, sleep (9th level), true polymorph

Magic Resistance:
Nicnevin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Legendary Resistance (3/day):
If Nicnevin fails a saving throw she can choose to succeed instead.

Token of Favor:
As an action, Nicnevin can cut a lock of her copper hair and twist it into a token for a creature she chooses. As long as that creature carries the token, it gains the magic resistance trait (see above). Nicnevin can revoke her favor at any time as a bonus action. When that happens, the creature loses the benefit of the token and, if Nicnevin wishes, the creature also has disadvantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects for 24 hours.

The Queen of Witches\'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Nicnevin takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Nicnevin can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Nicnevin causes a searing flare of moonlight to burst from a point she can see within 100 feet. All creatures Nicnevin chooses within 30 feet of that point take 13 (3d8) radiant damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Creatures not in their natural form have disadvantage on the saving throw, and if they fail, they revert to their natural form immediately (this does not affect any shape-changing effect created by Nicnevin).

- A wall of softly glowing crystal springs up from a solid surface in the lair. The wall is 60 feet long, 10 feet high, 5 feet thick, blocks line of sight, and sheds dim light out to 10 feet. Creatures within the wall’s area when it appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) radiant damage. The creature is pushed out of the wall’s space to whichever side it chooses. Each 5-foot section of the wall has AC 15, 10 hit points, resistance to fire, slashing, and piercing damage, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to thunder. The wall lasts until Nicnevin uses this action again or dies.

- Until initiative count 20 on the following round, any creatures other than fey who attempt to cast a spell must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or the spell fails and the spell slot is expended. A creature becomes aware of this effect the moment it begins casting a spell, and it can choose to take a different action instead.

Regional Effects:
the region containing Nicnevin’s lair is warped by the queen’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Calling Nicnevin’s name under the light of the moon within 10 miles of her lair draws Nicnevin’s attention (as if she cast a scrying spell). She may visit the supplicant and hear a request, especially if the request is repeated on multiple nights. For 24 hours after the invocation, Nicenvin has a connection to the area that allows her to target it with teleportation circle.

- Despite the weather, the moon is always visible for most of the night within 10 miles of the lair. Cloud cover has many breaks, or the moon’s light sharply penetrates the clouds.

- Silvery fog is common within 10 miles of the lair, and strange whispers are heard within the mist.

if Nicnevin dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.

Each creature within 10 feet of the quickstep must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw as the quickstep whirls in a blur of cold steel.

Lightning Stroke:
Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d6) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it can’t take reactions until the start of the ramag’s next turn.

Dimensional Seal (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):
The ramag magically empowers its gate seal to dampen teleportation, planar gates, and portals within 60 feet of it. A creature that attempts to teleport while within or into the area must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or the teleport fails. Spells and abilities that conjure creatures or objects automatically fail, and portals or gates are suppressed while they remain in the area. The seal lasts 1 hour, or until the ramag loses concentration on it as if concentrating on a spell.

Weave Dimensions:
The ramag creates two magical gateways in unoccupied spaces it can see within 100 feet of it. The gateways appear as shimmering, opaque ovals in the air. A creature that moves into one gateway appears at the other immediately. The gateways last for 1 minute, or until the ramag loses concentration on them as if concentrating on a spell.

at will: entangle, sleep

1/day each: heal, wall of thorns

The ravenala can move across undergrowth, natural or magical, without needing to make an ability check and without expending additional movement.

The ravenala makes two slam attacks or two bursting pod attacks.

Slam:

Bursting Pod:
Melee Ranged Attack: +8 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target and all creatures within 5 feet of it also take 5 (2d4) piercing damage, or half as much piercing damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

Lamenting Engulfment:
The ravenala targets a creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled and restrained by the ravenala. While restrained, the creature is engulfed inside the ravenala\'s trunk. The ravenala can grapple one creature at a time; grappling doesn\'t prevent it from using other attacks against different targets. The restrained creature must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a failure, the creature is compelled to sing a lament of all its various mistakes and misdeeds for as long as it remains restrained. Singing prevents uttering command words, casting spells with a verbal component, or any verbal communication. The restrained creature can still make melee attacks. When the ravenala moves, the restrained creature moves with it. A restrained creature can escape by using an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the ravenala.

                    'special_abilities' => 'Amphibious:
The River King can breathe air and water.

Innate Spellcasting:
the River King\'s innate spellcasting ability score is Charisma (save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). The River King can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components.

at will: create or destroy water, shocking grasp, water breathing

3/day each: freedom of movement, control water

1/day: chain lightning

Legendary Resistance (3/day):
If the River King fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

Magic Weapons:
The River King\'s weapon attacks are magical and do an extra 10 (3d6) lightning damage (included below).

The River King\'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the River King takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the River King can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The fey river swells and rushes over the land, or the walls of the Hall buckle and allow the torrent in. The River King chooses a 10-foot-wide path up to 60 feet long. Each creature in the path of the water must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. Creatures that fail the save are swept 20 feet down the path of the water and take 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage.

- The River King targets a creature he can see within 60 feet. That creature’s mouth and throat fill with river water. The creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the creature manages to hold its breath, but on a failure, it begins to suffocate. A suffocating but conscious creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. Another creature within 5 feet can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check. On a success, the suffocating creature coughs up the water and the effect ends. Otherwise the effect lasts until the River King uses this action again or dies.

- The River King targets a creature he can see within 120 feet. His commanding presence overwhelms the creature, who must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature is charmed by the River King until initiative count 20 on the following round.

Regional Effects:
the region containing the River King’s lair is warped by its magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- The current of rivers and streams within 6 miles of the lair becomes strong and erratic. Creatures without a swim speed who start their turns in running water must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check or be swept 60 feet downriver.

- Lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams within 6 miles of the lair teem with fish and other wildlife.

- Rain and thunderstorms are common within 6 miles of the lair, and often build to torrential downpours that create heavy obscurement and cause waterways to overflow their banks.

if the River King dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.

',
                    'attacks' => 'Multiattack:
The River King makes three attacks with his longsword and/or flood blast, in any combination.

Longsword:
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage or 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

Flood Blast:
Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage. A target creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed up to 60 feet at the River King\'s choosing.

Grasping Whirlpool (Recharge 5-6):
The River King magically creates a swirling vortex of water centered on a point he can see within 60 feet. The vortex fills a cylinder with a 10-foot radius and 15 feet high. Creatures in the area must make a successful DC 16 Strength saving throw or take 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage and be restrained and unable to breathe. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to the edge of the area. A restrained creature can escape from the whirlpool by using an action to make a successful DC 16 Strength check. A creature that\'s in the whirlpool at the end of its turn takes 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage in addition to any effects from being unable to breathe. Creatures with a swim speed have advantage on the saving throw and the Strength check to escape. The whirlpool lasts for 1 minute or until the River King uses this ability again.

3/day each: call lightning, gust of wind, lightning bolt

1/day: control weather

Rust Drake Lockjaw:
This disease manifests symptoms in 1d4 days, when the affected creature experiences painful muscle spasms, particularly in the jaw. After each long rest, the creature must repeat the saving throw. If it fails, the victim takes 1d3 Dexterity damage and is paralyzed for 24 hours; if the saving throw succeeds, the creature takes no damage and feels well enough to act normally for the day. This continues until the creature dies from Dexterity loss, recovers naturally by making successful saving throws after two consecutive long rests, or is cured with lesser restoration or comparable magic. After the disease ends, the victim recovers 1d3 lost Dexterity with each long rest; greater restoration or comparable magic can restore it all at once.

It must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the sand silhouette\'s turns or take 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the sand silhouette moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The sand silhouette can only engulf one creature at a time.

Haunted Haboob (Recharge 4-6):
The sand silhouette turns into a 60-foot radius roiling cloud of dust and sand filled with frightening shapes. A creature that starts its turn inside the cloud must choose whether to close its eyes and be blinded until the start of its next turn, or keep its eyes open and make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

the sandman\'s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

The hag can breathe air and water.

Horrific Appearance:
Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag\'s true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature\'s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag\'s Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.
Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag\'s true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.

Hag Coven:
When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.
A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.

Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only):
While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard\'s spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:

• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness
• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object
• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt
• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph
• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying
• 6th level (1 slot): eye bite

For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag\'s Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag\'s Intelligence modifier.

Hag Eye (Coven Only):
A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.
A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can\'t perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

                    'attacks' => 'Claws:
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

Death Glare:
The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 ft. of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.

Illusory Appearance:
The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.
The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

Sleep Poison:
An injured creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 2d6 rounds. A creature poisoned in this way is unconscious. An unconscious creature wakes if it takes damage, or if a creature uses its action to shake it awake.

Alien Piping:
A selang can confuse and injure its enemies by playing weird, ear-bending harmonies on alien pipes, made from the beaks, cartilage, and throat sacs of a dorreq. When the selang plays a tune on these pipes, all creatures within 60 feet must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by contagion, confusion, irresistible dance, or hideous laughter, depending on what alien and otherworldly music the dark satyr chooses to play. A creature that saves successfully against this psychic effect is immune to the piping for 24 hours. The selang can use each of these spell-like effects once per day.

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Stuporous Breath (Recharge 5-6):
The servant of the vine exhales potent fumes in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) poison damage and falls asleep, remaining unconscious for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage but doesn’t fall asleep. The unconscious target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. When the creature wakes, it is poisoned until it finishes a short or long rest. The breath has no effect on constructs or undead.

As a bonus action, the shabti commands its armlets to drop to the floor, whereupon they become two giant poisonous snakes. The shabti can mentally direct the serpents (this does not require an action). If the snakes are killed, they dissolve into wisps of smoke which reform around the shabti\'s forearms, and they can\'t be turned into snakes for 1 week.

Nabboot:
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with tomb taint. The cursed target\'s speed is reduced to half, and its hit point maximum decreases by 3 (1d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target\'s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or comparable magic.

Telekinesis:
The shabti targets a creature within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength check or the shabti moves it up to 30 feet in any direction (including upward), and it is restrained until the end of the shabti\'s next turn.

The ambassador uses its Withering Stare. It then makes three rapier attacks.

Rapier:
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage.

Honeyed Words (Recharges after a Long Rest):
The silver-tongued shadow fey ambassador weaves together a string of highly persuasive and agreeable words. Each creature within 30 feet of the ambassador must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the ambassador, regarding it as a wise and trustworthy ally with the creature’s best interests at heart. A charmed target doesn’t have to obey the ambassador’s commands, but it views the ambassador’s words in the most favorable way.

Each time a charmed target witnesses the shadow fey ambassador or its allies do something harmful to the target or its companions, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts as long as the ambassador maintains concentration, up to 8 hours.

Withering Stare:
The shadow fey ambassador targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see it, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the ambassador’s Withering Stare for the next 24 hours.

During its first turn, the shadow fey has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn. Any hit the poisoner scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

Born of Shadows:
When in dim light or darkness, the shadow fey poisoner is invisible.

Evasion:
If the shadow fey poisoner is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the poisoner instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

Fey Ancestry:
The shadow fey has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put it to sleep.

Shadow Traveler (4/Day):
As a bonus action while in shadows, dim light, or darkness, the shadow fey disappears into the darkness and reappears in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. A tendril of inky smoke appears at the origin and destination when it uses this trait.

Sneak Attack (1/Turn):
The shadow fey poisoner deals an extra 21 (6d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll; or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the poisoner, that ally isn’t incapacitated, and the poisoner doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

Sunlight Sensitivity:
While in sunlight, the shadow fey has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Traveler in Darkness:
The shadow fey has advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks made to know about shadow roads and shadow magic spells or items.

Magic Resistance:
The shantak has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

A shoggoth can move through a space as small as 1 foot wide. It must spend 1 extra foot of movement for every foot it moves through a space smaller than itself, but it isn\'t subject to any other penalties for squeezing.

The fluting noises made by a shoggoth are otherworldly and mind-shattering.

Keen Senses:
A shoggoth has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

Rolling Charge:
If the shoggoth moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, that creature must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. If the creature is knocked prone, the shoggoth immediately moves into the creature\'s space as a bonus action and crushes the creature beneath its bulk. The crushed creature can\'t breathe, is restrained, and takes 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the shoggoth\'s turns. A crushed creature remains in its space and does not move with the shoggoth. A crushed creature can escape by using an action and making a successful DC 19 Strength check.

The skein witch can step between places as a bonus action.

Sealed Destiny (1/Day):
The skein witch attunes herself to the threads of the PCs\' fates. Ask each player to write down their prediction of how the PC to their left will die, and at what level. Collect the notes without revealing the answers. When one of those PCs dies, reveal the prediction. If the character died in the manner predicted, they fulfill their destiny and are immediately resurrected by the gods as a reward.

Hit: 27 (5d8 + 5) radiant damage, and the target is "one step closer to death."If the target is reduced to 0 hit points, it\'s treated as if it\'s already failed one death saving throw. This effect is cumulative; each inexorable threads hit adds one unsuccessful death saving throw. If a character who\'s been hit three or more times by inexorable threads is reduced to 0 hit points, he or she dies immediately. This effect lasts until the character completes a long rest.

Bind Fates (1/Day):
One target within 60 feet of the skein witch must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target\'s fate is bound to one random ally of the target. Any damage or condition the target suffers is inflicted on the individual to which they are bound instead, and vice versa. A creature can be bound to only one other creature at a time. This effect lasts until either of the affected creatures gains a level, or until a heal or heroes\' feast lifts this binding.

Destiny Distortion Wave (Recharge 5-6):
The skein witch projects a 60-foot cone of distortion that frays the strands of fate. All targets in the cone take 55 (10d10) force damage, or half damage with a successful DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. In addition, if more than one target that failed its saving throw is affected by a condition, those conditions are randomly redistributed among the targets with failed saving throws.

On a failure, a target takes 21 (6d6) cold damage and is restrained by ice for 1 minute. On a success, a target takes half the damage and isn’t restrained. A restrained target can make a DC 13 Strength check, shattering the ice on a success. The ice can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire and bludgeoning damage; immunity to slashing, cold, poison, and psychic damage).

Illusory Appearance:
The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have human hands, but someone touching them would feel her sharp claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

Winter Step:
The Snow Queen ignores difficult terrain caused by ice and snow. She can walk on vertical and horizontal surfaces that are covered by ice or snow.

The Snow Queen\'s Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Snow Queen takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Snow Queen can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- A wall of dense snow springs into existence within 120 feet of the Snow Queen. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in the wall’s area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 18 (4d8) cold damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, on whichever side of the wall it chooses. A creature that touches the wall at any time takes the same damage. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. The wall lasts until the Snow Queen uses this action again, or she dies.

- Icy wind and stinging snow swirls around the Snow Queen. All creatures that aren’t immune to cold damage have disadvantage when making saving throws against cold damage or cold-based effects while within 60 feet of the Snow Queen. This effect lasts until initiative count 20 on the following round.

- The snow and ice of the lair shimmer and gleam, catching the light and flashing it into the eyes of the Snow Queen’s foes. Attack rolls against the Snow Queen and her allies within the lair have disadvantage until initiative count 20 on the following round.

Regional Effects:
the region containing the Snow Queen’s lair is warped by the fey lady’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Within 10 miles of the lair, snow and ice resist melting. Snow and ice can be melted only with prolonged contact with fire.

- The sky is overcast most of the time within 10 miles of the lair, and snowfall is common. The area is difficult terrain for Tiny, Small, and Medium creatures because of deep snow.

- Light snowfall or swirling powder blown by the wind lightly obscures the area within 5 miles of the lair.

if the Snow Queen dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.

The song angel blows on its ram’s horn, emitting a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 17 (5d6) thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage but isn’t deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 35 (10d6) thunder damage instead.

The song angel blows on its brass horn, calling forth 10 (3d4 + 3) warrior spirits. These spirits appear within 60 feet of the angel and use tribal warrior statistics. When the spirits are summoned, one of them is always an ancient champion that uses berserker statistics. They disappear after 1 hour or when they are reduced to 0 hp. These spirits follow the angel’s commands.

Change Shape:
The angel magically polymorphs into a humanoid that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the angel’s choice).

In the new form, the angel retains its game statistics and the ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.

Find Target:

Soul Drain:
If the soul eater reduces a target to 0 hit points, the soul eater can devour that creature\'s soul as a bonus action. The victim must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Success means the target is dead but can be restored to life by normal means. Failure means the target\'s soul is consumed by the soul eater and the target can\'t be restored to life with clone, raise dead, or reincarnation. A resurrection, miracle, or wish spell can return the target to life, but only if the caster succeeds on a DC 15 spellcasting check. If the soul eater is killed within 120 feet of its victim\'s corpse and the victim has been dead for no longer than 1 minute, the victim\'s soul returns to the body and restores it to life, leaving the victim unconscious and stable with 0 hit points.

The spirit lamp can’t be surprised and can use a bonus action to take the Disengage action.

Lantern’s Light:
As a bonus action, the spirit lamp can open or close its lantern. When open, the lantern sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The spirit lamp can only see objects within the lantern’s light and is blind while the lantern is closed. The lantern’s light pierces magical and nonmagical darkness and can’t be dispelled by magical darkness. If a creature dies in the lantern’s light, its spirit is trapped in the lantern.

Lantern Spirits:
Spirits of creatures that died within the lantern’s light haunt it. While the lantern is open, these spirits surround the spirit lamp, slowing and attacking all creatures within the lantern’s light. A creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the spirit lamp has its speed halved and must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the spirit lamp dies and the lantern is open, the lantern’s spirits continue to harm creatures within 30 feet of it until the lantern is destroyed or closed.

Spirit Lantern:
The spirit lamp’s lantern is immune to damage and can’t be the target of spells or effects as long as the spirit lamp lives. When the spirit lamp dies, the lantern floats gently to the ground and opens, if it was closed. The lantern has AC 17, 50 hp, and is immune to piercing, poison, and psychic damage. A creature that touches the lantern must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be cursed. A cursed creature is frightened of darkness, can’t see anything outside of the lantern’s light, and is unable to drop the lantern. The cursed creature will risk its own life to protect the lantern. A creature can repeat the saving throw each day at dawn, lifting the curse and ending the effects on itself on a success. If this occurs, the lantern disintegrates. After three failed saving throws, remove curse or similar magic is required to end the curse.

If the creature remains cursed after 30 days, it is irreversibly changed by the curse, and it becomes the lantern’s new spirit lamp. Voluntarily opening the lantern counts as a failed saving throw. If the lantern is destroyed, all captured spirits are put to rest and the cursed bearer, if it has not yet changed into a spirit lamp, is freed of the curse.

If a creature confused by the spree demon’s claw attack reduces a target to 0 hp, the confused creature must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or gain a short-term madness (see the System Reference Document 5.1). If a creature fails this saving throw again while already suffering from a madness, it gains a long-term madness instead.

The spree demon makes two claw attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened this way, the creature believes it has shrunk to half its normal size. All attacks against the creature do an extra 7 (2d6) psychic damage, and the creature’s attacks do half damage. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Claw:
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage, and the creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn for 1 minute. This works like the confusion spell. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.

The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 32 (5d10 + 5) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target\'s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

Etherealness:
The fiend magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.

When a creature that can see the sunset raptor’s tail starts its turn within 100 feet of the raptor, the raptor can force it to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw if the raptor isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failure, a creature becomes charmed until the start of its next turn. While charmed, the creature is incapacitated as it suffers from surreal hallucinations and must move up to its speed closer to the raptor that charmed it. It doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the sunset raptor, a target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Other sunset raptors are immune to this effect.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see the sunset raptor until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the sunset raptor in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

Pack Tactics:
The sunset raptor has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the raptor’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.

Frightful Presence:
Each creature of the tarrasque\'s choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute.

While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque\'s turns.

Claw:
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) slashing damage plus 26 (4d12) cold damage. If the target is wearing metal armor, it must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.

Freezing Breath (Recharge 5-6):
The thuellai exhales an icy blast in a 40-foot cone. Each target in the area takes 39 (6d12) cold damage, or half damage with a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw.

Algid Aura:
All creatures within 10 feet of a thuellai take 7 (2d6) cold damage at the beginning of the thuellai\'s turn. Spells or magical effects that protect against cold are affected as if by a dispel magic spell (the theullai\'s effective spellcasting bonus is +5) if a thuellai is within 20 feet of the target at the start of the theullai\'s turn, and nonmagical flames within 20 feet of the thuellai are extinguished at the start of its turn.

Howl of the Maddening Wind (3/day):
a thuellai\'s howl can cause creatures to temporarily lose their minds and even to attack themselves or their companions. Each target within 100 feet of the theullai and able to hear the howl must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or roll 1d8 and consult the table below at the start of its next turn. An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns; a success ends the effect on itself, but a failure means it must roll again on the table below at the start of its next turn.

1 - Act normally

2-4 - Do nothing but babble incoherently

5-6 - Do 1d8 damage + Str modifier to self with item in hand

7-8 - Attack nearest target; select randomly if more than one

Blizzard (1/Day):
The thuellai creates an icy blizzard in the area around it. A 50-foot radius sphere surrounding the theullai fills with icy fog, whirling snow, and driving ice crystals. Vision is lightly obscured, and creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on vision or hearing. The ground in the affected area becomes difficult terrain. The effect lasts for 10 minutes and moves with the theullai.

If the hive-queen fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Hive Mind:
The hive-queen is the psychic nexus for every tosculi in her hive. She is aware of the direction and distance to all members of the hive, can telepathically communicate with them when they are within 20 miles, and can sense what they sense when they are within 1 mile of her. Tosculi from her hive that travel more than 20 miles away instinctively know the direction and distance to the hive and try to return. Hive-queens sometimes dispatch rescue missions to recover separated members of the hive.

Hive Queen Lair:
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hive-queen takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- The tosculi hive-queen releases a cloud of pheromones that drives the tosculi to fight harder. All tosculi within 60 feet of the hive-queen (including the hive-queen herself) regain 7 (2d6) hit points.

- A swarm of tiny tosculi offspring crawls from its nest and attacks a creature within 120 feet of the hive-queen, automatically doing 10 (4d4) piercing damage. Then the swarm dies.

- The ceiling above one creature that the hive-queen can see within 120 feet of her drips sticky resin. The creature must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be encased in rapidly-hardening resin. A creature encased this way is restrained. It can free itself, or another creature within 5 feet can free it, by using an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the creature is still encased the next time the initiative count reaches 20, the resin hardens, trapping it. The trapped creature can’t move or speak; attack rolls against it have disadvantage because it is encased in resin armor; it automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws; and it has resistance to all damage. The trapped creature is released when the resin is destroyed (AC 10, 20 HP, immune to cold, fire, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, and piercing damage).

the tosculi hive-queen can’t repeat an effect until they have all been used, and she can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.

Regional Effects:
the region containing a tosculi hive-queen’s lair is warped by the creature’s presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Intelligent creatures within 6 miles suffer frequent headaches. It’s as if they had a constant buzzing inside their heads.

- Beasts within 6 miles are more irritable and violent than usual and have the Blood Frenzy trait:The beast has advantage on melee attack rolls against a creature that doesn’t have all its hit points.

if the tosculi hive-queen dies, the buzzing disappears immediately, and the beasts go back to normal within 1d10 days.

A paralyzed target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Glitter Dust:
The hive-queen produces a cloud of glittering golden particles in a 30-foot radius. Each creature that is not a tosculi in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Implant Egg:
The hive-queen implants an egg into an incapacitated creature within 5 feet of her that is neither undead nor a construct. Until the egg hatches or is removed, the creature is poisoned, paralyzed, and does not need to eat or drink. The egg hatches in 1d6 weeks, and the larval tosculi kills the host creature. The implanted egg can be removed with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check or by a spell or magical effect that cures disease.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can’t see the drone until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the drone in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

Devil\'s Mark:
Totivillus sprays magical ink from his fingertips at a single target within 30 feet. The target must make a successful DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or receive a devil\'s mark: a tattoo in the shape of Totivillus\'s personal seal. All devils have advantage on spell attacks made against the devil.marked creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws made against spells and abilities used by devils. The mark can be removed by remove curse if the caster also makes a successful DC 23 spellcasting check. The mark reveals itself as desecrated to detect evil and good. It often shifts its position on the body, especially when it\'s concealed (and usually at the most inconvenient moment). Because such marks are sometimes placed on those who\'ve made pacts with devils, NPC paladins and clerics might assume that any character bearing a devil\'s mark is in league with evil forces.

Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions):
Totivillus casts a spell from its list of prepared spells, using a spell slot as normal.

Fear Aura:
Any creature hostile to Totivillus that starts its turn within 20 feet of him must make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw, unless Totivillus is incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. If a creature\'s saving throw is successful, it is immune to the devil\'s Fear Aura for the next 24 hours.

Spellcasting:
totivillus is a 20th-level spellcaster who uses Intelligence as his spellcasting ability (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). He requires no material components to cast his spells. Totivillus has the following wizard spells prepared:

cantrips (at will): chill touch, light, minor illusion, poison spray, prestidigitation

1st level (4 slots): comprehend languages, disguise self, illusory script, magic missile, unseen servant

2nd level (3 slots): blindness/deafness, hold person, mirror image, misty step

3rd level (3 slots): counterspell, dispel magic, haste, protection from energy

4th level (3 slots): banishment, dimension door, greater invisibility, polymorph

5th level (3 slots): dominate person, geas, modify memory, passwall

6th level (2 slots): eyebite, guards and wards, mass suggestion

7th level (2 slots): forcecage, plane shift

8th level (1 slot): feeblemind

9th level (1 slot): time stop

Magic Resistance:
The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Magic Weapons:
Totivillus\'s weapon attacks are magical.

Meld with Text:
Totivillus can enter any book, scroll, or other written material and remain hidden there as long as he wishes. If the text is damaged or destroyed, he is ejected from it without suffering damage.

Trust Aura:
Totivillus projects a 25-foot-radius trust aura. As long as Totivillus is talking, creatures in that area find his utterances so fascinating and compelling that they must make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of their turns; if the saving throw fails, they can\'t attack Totivillus directly until the start of their next turn. This effect ends immediately and can\'t be renewed for 1 minute if Totivillus attacks physically. Devils are not immune to this aura.

Regeneration:
The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn\'t function at the start of the troll\'s next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn\'t regenerate.

Variant: Loathsome Limbs:
Whenever the troll takes at least 15 slashing damage at one time, roll a d20 to determine what else happens to it:

**1-10:** Nothing else happens.
**11-14:** One leg is severed from the troll if it has any legs left.
**15- 18:** One arm is severed from the troll if it has any arms left.
**19-20:** The troll is decapitated, but the troll dies only if it can\'t regenerate. If it dies, so does the severed head.

If the troll finishes a short or long rest without reattaching a severed limb or head, the part regrows. At that point, the severed part dies. Until then, a severed part acts on the troll\'s initiative and has its own action and movement. A severed part has AC 13, 10 hit points, and the troll\'s Regeneration trait.
A **severed leg** is unable to attack and has a speed of 5 feet.
A **severed arm** has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll unless the troll can see the arm and its target. Each time the troll loses an arm, it loses a claw attack.
If its head is severed, the troll loses its bite attack and its body is blinded unless the head can see it. The **severed head** has a speed of 0 feet and the troll\'s Keen Smell trait. It can make a bite attack but only against a target in its space.
The troll\'s speed is halved if it\'s missing a leg. If it loses both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can\'t benefit from bonuses to speed.

If the tusked crimson ogre doesn’t have all of its hp, it flexes and roars, spraying blood from its wounds. Each creature within 15 feet of the ogre must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) acid damage and goes berserk. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn’t go berserk. On each of its turns, a berserk creature must attack the nearest creature it can see, eschewing ranged or magical attacks in favor of melee attacks. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the berserk creature attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once a creature goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is unconscious, regains all of its hp, or is cured through lesser restoration or similar magic.

Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6):
The ursa polaris exhales a blast of freezing wind and shards of ice in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) cold damage and 14 (4d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The ursa polaris sways its back, causing the ice formations on its shoulders to catch available light.

The effect also ends if the creature takes any damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it out of its stupor.

If the vampire isn\'t in sun light or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.
While in bat form, the vampire can\'t speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
While in mist form, the vampire can\'t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature\'s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can\'t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day):
If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Misty Escape:
When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn\'t in sunlight or running water. If it can\'t transform, it is destroyed.
While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can\'t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.

Regeneration:
The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn\'t in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn\'t function at the start of the vampire\'s next turn.

Spider Climb:
The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

Vampire Weaknesses:
The vampire has the following flaws:
Forbiddance. The vampire can\'t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
Harmed by Running Water. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.
Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire\'s heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.
Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target\'s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire\'s control.

Charm:
The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn\'t under the vampire\'s control, it takes the vampire\'s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire\'s bite attack.
Each time the vampire or the vampire\'s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.

The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn\'t up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.

A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage and an extra 3 (1d6) necrotic damage when the vampire patrician hits with it (included in the attack).

Misty Escape:
When it drops to 0 hp outside its resting place, the vampire patrician transforms into a cloud of mist instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn’t in sunlight or running water. If it can’t transform, it is destroyed. While it has 0 hp in mist form, it can’t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed.

While in mist form it can’t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can’t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.

Once in its resting place, it reverts to vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hp. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hp, it regains 1 hp.

Noble Resilience (Recharges after a Long Rest):
The vampire patrician can ignore the effects of sunlight for up to 1 minute.

Regeneration:
The patrician regains 15 hp at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hp and isn’t in sunlight or running water. If it takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn’t function at the start of its next turn.

Spider Climb:
The vampire patrician can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

Vampire Weaknesses:
The vampire patrician has the following flaws:
Forbiddance. The patrician can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
Harmed by Running Water. The patrician takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.
Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the patrician’s heart while the patrician is incapacitated in its resting place, the patrician is paralyzed until the stake is removed.
Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The patrician takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire patrician, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target’s hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the patrician regains hp equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire patrician’s control.

Bone-Chilling Gaze:
The vampire patrician targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet. If the target can see the patrician, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or become paralyzed with fear until the end of its next turn.

Release the Hounds! (1/Day):
The vampire patrician calls 4d6 hunting hounds (use mastiff statistics) to its side. While outdoors, the vampire patrician can call 4d6 hunting raptors (use blood hawk statistics) instead. These creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, helping the patrician and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the patrician dies, or until the patrician dismisses them as a bonus action.

Each time the vampire priestess or her allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. The target can also repeat the saving throw if another creature uses an action to shake the target out of its stupor.

While the vesiculosa remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal pool of water.

Rich Sapphire Heartvine:
A vesiculosa\'s heartvine resembles a lump of sapphire and is highly prized by alchemists (worth 1,000 gp). It can be reached with an hour or two of hard digging.

Rootlet Swarms:
The vesiculosa is surrounded at all times by four Medium swarms of Tiny rootlets that move as the vesiculosa directs. Each swarm has a speed of 30 feet, can be targeted independently, has 25 hit points, and (unlike the parent plant) quite vulnerable to fire damage. Other than that, they have the same statistics as the vesiculosa\'s main body. For each swarm that drops to 0 hit points, the vesiculosa loses one of its Entrap attacks. A destroyed swarm regrows in 24 hours.

Sweet Water:
The vesiculosa\'s pool emits a sweet fragrance that lures creatures to drink. Creatures that are neither undead nor constructs within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to approach the vesiculosa and drink. The water is cool and refreshing but carries a sleeping poison: any creature (other than undead and constructs) that drinks from it regains 1d4 hp and recovers from 1 level of exhaustion, but must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against poison or fall unconscious for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is unconscious for 1 hour. An unconscious creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature uses an action to shake it awake.

Verdant:
The vesiculosa\'s sap seeps into the soil, promoting lush vegetation. At any given time, 3d6 beneficial fruits (fruit, nuts, figs, dates) can be found within 30 feet of the vesiculosa. These have the same effect as berries from a goodberry spell, but they retain their potency for one week after being picked or after the vesiculosa is killed.

',
                    'attacks' => 'Multiattack:
The vesiculosa uses Entrap 4 times, and uses Reel and Engulf once each. It loses one Entrap attack for each rootlet swarm that\'s been destroyed.

Entrap:
The vesiculosa targets a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of one of its rootlet swarms. The target takes 10 (4d4) piercing damage and is grappled (escape DC 15), or takes half damage and isn\'t grappled if it makes a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained, it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and that rootlet swarm can\'t entrap another target.

Reel:
Each rootlet swarm that has a creature grappled moves up to 20 feet toward the vesiculosa\'s main body. Rootlets wander up to 100 feet from the main body.

Engulf:
The vesiculosa engulfs all restrained or unconscious creatures within 5 feet of its main body (up to 2 Large, 4 Medium or 8 Small creatures). An engulfed creature is restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the vesiculosa, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the vesiculosa\'s turns. When the vesiculosa moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by using an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the vesiculosa\'s main body.

Claw:
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage.

Spore Sacs (1/week):
The vine lord can release seeds from specialized sacs on its tendrils. These seeds sprout into 1d4 green spore pods that reach maturity in 3 days. The pods contain noxious spores that are released when the pod is stepped on, picked, or otherwise tampered with. A humanoid or beast that inhales these spores must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw against disease or tendrils start growing inside the creature\'s body. If the disease is not cured within 3 months, the tendrils take over the creature\'s nervous system and the victim becomes a tendril puppet.

The vine lord magically animates one or two trees it can see within 60 feet of it. These trees have the same statistics as a treant, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can\'t speak, and they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the vine lord. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the vine lord dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the vine lord takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible.

The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.
A vrock has a 30 percent chance of summoning 2d4 dretches or one vrock.
A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can\'t summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6):
The war machine golem breathes fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The water leaper lets out a blood-curdling shriek.

Swallow:
The water leaper makes a bite attack against a medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, and has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the water leaper. A swallowed target takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of the water leaper\'s turn. The water leaper can have one creature swallowed at a time.

The weirding scroll can have only one humanoid under its control at one time. If it dominates another, the effect on the previous target ends.

The white ape does one extra die of damage (d8 or d10, respectively) per attack against an enemy it has seen cast a spell.

Arcane Wasting (Disease):
When the bodily fluid of an infected creature touches a humanoid or when an infected creature casts a spell (direct or indirect) on a humanoid, that humanoid must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with arcane wasting. Beginning 1d6 days after infection, the infected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each long rest. If the saving throw fails, the victim loses 1d3 Intelligence and 1d3 Wisdom. Lost Intelligence and Wisdom can\'t be recovered while the disease persists. If the saving throw succeeds, nothing happens; the disease ends after the second consecutive successful saving throws. Once the disease ends, lost Intelligence and Wisdom can be restored by greaterrestoration or comparable magic. The disease is also cured by lesser restoration if the caster makes a successful DC 15 spellcasting check.

Claw:
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage.

Frenzy (1/Day):
When two or more foes are adjacent to the ape, it can enter a deadly battle frenzy. Instead of using its normal multiattack, a frenzied white ape makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against each enemy within 5 feet of it. Melee attacks against the white ape are made with advantage from the end of that turn until the start of the white ape\'s next turn.

The xhkarsh makes two claw attacks and two stinger attacks.

Claw:
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.

Stinger:
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or have its fate corrupted. A creature with corrupted fate has disadvantage on Charisma checks and Charisma saving throws, and it is immune to divination spells and to effects that sense emotions or read thoughts. The target\'s fate can be restored by a dispel evil and good spell or comparable magic.

Seize Strand:
The xhkarsh targets one creature within 5 feet of it whose fate has been corrupted. The target creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or a portion of the xhkarsh\'s consciousness inhabits its body. The target retains control of its body, but the xhkarsh can control its actions for 1 minute each day and can modify its memories as a bonus action (as if using the modify memory spell, DC 15). The target is unaware of the xhkarsh\'s presence, but can make a DC 18 Wisdom (Insight) check once every 24 hours to notice the presence of the xhkarsh. This effect lasts until the xhkarsh ends it or the target\'s fate is restored by a dispel evil and good spell or comparable magic. A creature becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours when it succeeds on the saving throw to resist the effect or after the effect ends on it for any reason. A single xhkarsh can seize up to four strands at the same time.

Invisibility:
The xhkarsh turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends. Equipment the xhkarsh wears or carries becomes invisible with it.

Each creature within 120 feet that is able to hear the sound must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or return the hooting sound, if it can make noise.

When the ychen bannog takes the Dash action, it can move through the space of a Large or smaller creature, treating the creature\'s space as difficult terrain. As it moves through the creature\'s space, the ychen bannog can make a stomp attack as a bonus action.

Peaceful Creature:
The ychen bannog abhors combat and flees from it if possible. If unable to flee, the ychen bannog can attack a foe or obstacle to clear a path to safety. As an action, a driver or handler mounted on the ychen bannog or adjacent to it can make a DC 16 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. On a success, the ychen bannog moves and attacks as directed by the driver. On a failure, the beast flees. The driver or handler must have proficiency in Animal Handling to attempt this check.

Claw:
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.

Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6):
The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons:

Gravitic Breath:
The dragon exhales a 30-foot cube of powerful localized gravity, originating from the dragon.

Falling damage in the area increases to 1d10 per 10 feet fallen:
When a creature starts its turn within the area or enters it for the first time in a turn, including when the dragon creates the field, it must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure the creature is restrained. On a success the creature\'s speed is halved as long as it remains in the field. A restrained creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn. The field persists until the dragon\'s breath recharges, and it can\'t use gravitic breath twice consecutively.

Stellar Flare Breath:
The dragon exhales star fire in a 30- foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage and 28 (8d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

If the zaratan dies, swallowed creatures are no longer restrained and can escape by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.

Lake Leap:
A zmey spends much of its time lurking in lakes and ponds. When submerged in a natural pool of standing water, it can transport itself as a bonus action to a similar body of water within 5,000 feet. Rapidly flowing water doesn\'t serve for this ability, but the zmey can leap to or from a river or stream where the water is calm and slow-moving.

Legendary Resistance (1/Day):
If the zmey fails a saving throw, it can count it as a success instead.

Multiheaded:
The zmey normally has three heads. While it has more than one head, the zmey has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, and stunned. If the zmey takes 40 or more damage in a single turn (and the damage isn\'t poison or psychic), one of its heads is severed. If all three of its heads are severed, the zmey dies.

Regeneration:
The zmey regains 15 hit points at the start of its turn. If the zmey takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn\'t function at the start of the zmey\'s next turn. Regeneration stops functioning when all heads are severed. It takes 24 hours for a zmey to regrow a functional head.

Spawn Headling:
The severed head of a zmey grows into a zmey headling 2d6 rounds after being separated from the body. Smearing at least a pound of salt on the severed head\'s stump prevents this transformation.

The zoryas’ weapon attacks are magical. When the zoryas hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 3d8 radiant or fire damage (included in the attack). The zoryas chooses whether its attack does radiant or fire damage before making the attack roll.

Open Celestial Gate:
As an action, the zoryas opens a gateway to the celestial plane. The gate appears as a shimmering circle that sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet and is framed by twisting, golden strands. The gate lasts 1 hour; though, the zoryas can choose to close it at any time as a bonus action. Once the gate closes, the zoryas is reduced to 0 hp and remains unconscious for six days, awakening, fully restored, at sunrise on the seventh day. The zoryas can’t pass through its own gate.

Regeneration:
The zoryas regains 10 hp at the start of its turn. If the zoryas takes necrotic damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the zoryas’ next turn. The zoryas’ body is destroyed only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn’t regenerate.

Sun’s Guidance (3/Day):
The zoryas has advantage on melee attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

The angel makes two morningstar attacks.

Morningstar:
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) radiant or fire damage.

Light of Dawn (Recharges after a Long Rest):
The zoryas’ lantern brightens, bathing its environs in brilliant light. Each creature within 30 feet of the zoryas must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. An undead creature who fails this save also takes 13 (3d8) fire damage. The light dispels up to three spells or other magical effects of 3rd level or lower like the dispel magic spell within the area.

Dusk’s Arrival (Recharges after a Long Rest):
The zoryas’ lantern darkens, snuffing out nearby natural and magical sources of light. Each creature within 30 feet of the zoryas must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The area is bathed in darkness like the darkness spell until the end of the zoryas’ next turn.
